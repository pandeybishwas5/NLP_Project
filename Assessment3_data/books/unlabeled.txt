      "review_text": "McCarthy's writing and portrayal of Lester Ballard, a necrophiliac, is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape. And then you have to wonder...why am I siding with a necrophiliac of all people? The writing is up to the high standards expected of McCarthy, and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche. The book has an interesting twist to the plot - Ballard is falsely accused of rape, his house is auctioned off and he's left as a social outcast, an animal. He is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal. If you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read"

If so, look no further, this book is for you.\n\nI understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so \"grotesque\" or \"disturbing\" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.\n\nThe entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time"

      "review_text": "I was initiated into the world of Cormac McCarthy with this novel in Southern Lit class.  My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to"

However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was &quot;WE SELL THE EARTH.&quot; C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community"

But McCarthy is more fun to read; his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind's eye.  He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  &quot;Child of God&quot; is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.  But that is one of the great joys of Cormac McCarthy's early novels--they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of  beautifully painted landscape and haunting, nightmarish imagery"

Here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings.  Lester Ballard is the ultimate user.  Other people exist for him only to meet his needs, even if they are dead.  I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.  I don't think the title is meant to be ironic.  I think we are meant to see that even Lester Ballard really is a child of God"

Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs"

      "review_text": "\"Ha ha ha hah ha hah!\"  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this \"Tolkein as faith\" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the \"thanks for the buck buddy\" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!\n\nMy recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for"

      "reviewer_location": "Smyrna, GA USA",
      "review_text": "The Protector's War (2005) is the second Alternate History novel in the Change series, following Dies the Fire.  In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.\n\nIn this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.\n\nWhen the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.\n\nNigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.\n\nAt Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.\n\nLord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.\n\nIn McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.\n\nThis story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.\n\nBTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?\n\nHighly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.\n\n-Arthur W. Jordi"

Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing"

      "review_text": "I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like \"what just happened!\". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.\n\nAlso leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.\n\nThere seem to be no faults in the utopian \"good guys\" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.\n\nAlthough I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.\n\nThe mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional \"Clans\". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.\n\nBut it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:\n\nWhat happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.\n\nThat is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.\n\nI love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it"

The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again.  A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed.  The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels.\nI found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops.  No spoilers, so I won't elaborate other than to suggest \"Gathers the Storm\" or somthing similar might have ben a better title.  Hopefully \"A Meeting at Corvallis\" will be equally entertaining"

      "review_text": "Mr. Stirling has succeded again.  Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read.  Honestly, I don't know where to start when explaining how good it is, so I will let you know the one thing I found highly disappointing about it, in one word:\nWicca.\nThat's right, Mr. Sterling has filled this book with so much \"blessed be's\" and \"Lord and Lady\" junk that you have to actually wade around that gobbledeegook to get to the real story.  In fact, if it weren't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I'd have given this book two, maybe three stars.  Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here.  Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism/Islam in Africa, Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism/Shintoism/Anamism in Asia, etc.  But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the \"Lord and Lady\" actually interact with some of the characters.  Yet the characters don't sit there and think to themselves, \"Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!\"  Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind.  Oh, well.  My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum.  We don't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let's try to keep to a minimum the \"blessed be's\" or \"lord and lady\" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay"

I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library."

      "review_text": "Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's \"American Colonies\" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do.  This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution.\n\nAmong the Revolution's motives were \"liberty\" (a better form of government than that provided by London) and \"empire\" (eliminating British barriers to the colonies' territorial expansion).  Since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists' territorial expansion, giving them a larger role in the history, as Taylor does, makes the history read more in the \"imperial\" vein.  See chapter 18, \"Imperial Wars and Crisis: 1739-75.\"\n\nIn an important way, the \"liberty\" and \"empire\" motives both came down to land.  The colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average Briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples.  Jefferson summed up their objective as \"an empire of liberty,\" which Taylor uses as chapter 18's final section heading"

Moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and Indians.\n\nDespite being an American History buff, it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that I realized how little I knew.  Taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the Spanish, French, English, Swedish, Dutch, German, etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the United States.  There are plenty of fascinating details about exploration, the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies.  More importantly, this book provides a solid background for why the English-speaking colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period.\n\nA well-written and well-researched book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about.  This is history that is hard to put down"

      "review_text": "Traditionally, coverage of \"colonial America\" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage.  Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.\n\nHis scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.\n\nTaylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.\n\nAs the first book in the \"Penguin History of the United States,\" Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come"

      "review_text": "Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done"

      "review_text": "Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.\n\nA tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.\n\nRegarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.\n\nI recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans."

      "review_text": "Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.\n\nWhen Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).\n\nOn the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.\n\nOf course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.\n\nWhile the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.\n\nA very good read"

      "review_text": "Over the years I have read many books on the Red Scare in Hollywood and could never quite understand the attraction to communism.  This book does the best job of describing the issues, the attraction to communism and documentation of actual plans by the communist party concerning their intent to influence films.  In reading many past books, the authors never quite expressed WHY they were communists.  In fact, many of the books never mentioned whether they were incorrectly persecuted or whether they actually were members of communist party.  This book provides documentation and reasoning by none other than Dalton Trumbo, one of the leading communists in Hollywood and the screenwriter partially responsible for breaking the blacklist.  And in the end, he disavowed his former communist party and their teachings.\n\nBut this book will not be without controversy as the authors are known as right-wing Republicans.  While I am in the middle of the political spectrum leaning slightly to the left, I find their account very believable and documented sufficiently to overcome any perceived bias.  The significance of this book to me from reading Ring Lardner's famous \"I'd Hate Myself in the Morning\" to watching Woody Allen's \"The Front\" and FINALLY getting a closing answer is overwhelming.  I no longer feel the need to explore why Americans chose to follow another government's agenda to the potential detriment of our country.  However, I do not fault these people for their initial attraction to communism and frankly, I don't view communism as wrong:  it's just a different government method some choose.  For myself, I remain quite satisfied with democracy, EVEN in these trying times.  Rather, the attraction to communism was clearly a byproduct of the recent depression as well as the growth of fascism.  I can live with that reasoning.\n\nThis is an exceptional book if you have any interest in the 50s, movies, or communism.  In closing, I must comment on the complete disrespect shown to Elia Kazen on receipt of his lifetime achievement award some years ago when Nick Nolte and others refused to applaud or acknowledge this award.  I suggest they read this book.  The Red Scare was a horrible period but Freedom of Speech needs only go so far when supporting a government with intent to overthrow our own.  I strongly recommend this book."

      "review_text": "While George Clooney was simultaneously thumping his chest and patting his back for how he and his \"community\" are proudly out of touch with mainstream America, I was engaged in the rather more edifying exercise of reading this great new book by Ronald and Allis Radosh. For readers with an interest in the context of the culture-clash between the \"Hollywood elite\" and the poor benighted people who buy movie tickets and DVDs, this book is an excellent resource.\n\nI say the \"context\" of the clash because this is a look at history, and a serious research work too. This is not a book that details the fashionable Leftist obsessions of Clooney, Streisand, Penn, and the rest, and therefore may be less satisfying to some readers than other recent books that address current names and controversies more directly. Instead, \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" digs deep into something far more serious and sinister (\"sinister\" comes from the Latin word for \"left,\" by the way): the film colony's infiltration by agents of the Comintern, dedicated partisans of Stalin, and other actors, directors, writers, and executives eager to use the power of film to promote socialism in the United States.\n\nAs Clooney's speech -- and even more so, his movie -- make clear, modern Hollywood's sense of itself is built to a large degree on the legend of its heroic stand against \"McCarthyism\" and the blacklist (that's what makes Clooney's self-congratulation so laughable -- does anyone in Hollywood *defend* McCarthy?). But the Radoshes demonstrate not only that there really were communists in positions of influence (in other words, the witch-hunt turned up real witches), but that there was also a strong and active anti-communist Left in Hollywood. Even more than the relatively small number of conservatives in Hollywood, it was this anti-communist Left that was in the most direct conflict with the Stalinists, their apologists, and their dupes, particularly before and during World War II.\n\nAll of this is important information, but it's when they turn to their discussion of HUAC and the blacklist in the postwar period that the authors most directly confront Hollywood's defining myth. Far from the usual pop-psychology analysis of the deranged and sweaty McCarthy (and why do so few people seem to notice that *Senator* Joe McCarthy had nothing to do with the *House* Committee on Un-American Activities?) the authors have gone in-depth in committee records, and also into the backgrounds of the people from Hollywood who came before the committee. It's certainly easier to issue blanket denunciations of McCarthy and his ilk than to sift through pages and pages of dusty documents. Ronald and Allis Radosh are to be commended for doing the latter.\n\nIt's because this book is so heavily researched -- so filled with names, dates, and places -- that I note again that it may not be to everyone's taste. It is, I repeat, a work of history. It notably lacks the rhetorical sledgehammer blows of, say, an Ann Coulter book, and so doesn't have the fist-pumping, take-that-you-commie excitement value some readers derive from more polemical works. But those books seem to disappear as soon as they fall off the bestseller lists. This, on the other hand, is a book that deserves to be around for a long, long time"

      "review_text": "Remember the Hollywood blacklist? The Hollywood Ten? I'll bet you know a lot about these events even if you weren't alive in the 1950s. That's because Tinseltown has a vested interest in keeping the memory of this era alive. It was the era of the Red Scare, of Senator Joseph McCarthy waving his infamous list of communist subversives during a speech in West Virginia. It was the time of congressional investigations, a time when invoking the Fifth Amendment might keep you safe from a contempt charge but would make you look guilty as sin in the public eye. For a select few the McCarthy era was a time of great fear, and no one feared this witch-hunt against communism more than Hollywood. Why? Because, despite the mountains of claims to the contrary that have emerged over the years, the movie industry oozed communists. There were so many Reds in Hollywood that they should have renamed the town Little Moscow. Yet even today, you won't hear about this truth in the media. You will, however, get the skinny on what really went on if you pick up a copy of Ronald Radosh's \"Red Star Over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left.\"\n\nTalk about exploding myths! Radosh's book, which he co-wrote with his wife Allis, cuts through the layers of denial and presents us with an ugly picture of the real Hollywood of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Vladimir Lenin, the little pipsqueak who brought the nightmare of Marxism to the Soviet Union back in the early part of the twentieth century, had a soft spot for film and theater. He believed that the best way to spread communism around the globe was through movies and plays. This is exactly what the Kremlin crowd set out to accomplish in the following decades. They managed to gain converts to their cause--men who later became movers and shakers like Budd Schulberg, Joseph Losey, and Maurice Rapf--by allowing them to work closely with the Soviet film industry. Once these people came back to the United States, they spread their plague to others with the help of party apparatchiks Willi Munzenberg, V.J. Jerome, and John Howard Lawson. In no time at all, writes Radosh, a branch of the communist party flourished in Hollywood. So many big names signed on that newcomers to the industry, in an attempt to make contacts and find work, had to become communists or fellow travelers themselves.\n\nThe Hollywood branch of the communist party worked to increase their membership and influence in several ways. One of the most successful methods involved the tried and true \"United Frontism\" and \"Popular Front\" techniques, or the forming of organizations that on the surface embraced popular progressive causes to lure in unsuspecting liberals while maintaining strong communist control behind the scenes. Radosh reveals that the concerns many people had about the rise of National Socialist Germany in the 1930s helped increase membership, although the party's propensity to change direction, oftentimes overnight according to directives issued from the Kremlin, tended to alienate many members. Also off putting was the heavy-handed discipline that could fall on an unsuspecting member at any time. Albert Maltz, for example, discovered the inflexibility of the party when he wrote an article deemed \"revisionist\" by the upper hierarchy. His very public refutation of his article left little doubt about the strong-arm tactics used behind the scenes. Despite the ugliness the Hollywood Reds occasionally displayed, they were somewhat successful in spreading their propaganda through films like \"Mission to Moscow,\" \"The Spanish Earth,\" and \"The North Star.\" Congressional investigations threw some of these dupes in the slammer, and silenced a few more, but many never repudiated their warped views.\n\nI enjoyed Radosh's book, the first one of his I've had the chance to read. The author and his spouse obviously know what they're talking about and, since Ronald Radosh himself was a communist for many years, he understands how these groups think and act. \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" occasionally suffers from dry prose and a bewildering number of groups and individuals, but the authors always manage to bring the book back up to speed by throwing in some great anecdotes. For instance, the part where we learn about Ronald Reagan (at the time a liberal) and his buddy William Holden crashing a communist get together in an attempt to inject some common sense into the proceedings is great fun to read about. Reagan got up and started talking only to find himself under verbal attack for some forty minutes. God bless him! The account of Albert Maltz's forced rehabilitation is absolutely chilling, a sobering tale that hints at the violent tendencies inherent in communism. Arguably the best part of the book, however, involves the long, strange trip writer Dalton Trumbo took from the time of his blacklisting to his repudiation of the communist party later in life.  So many intriguing stories pop up in the book that the actual creation of the blacklist takes a backseat.\n\nI have one recommendation and one warning to those readers about to attempt the book. In the case of the former, if you're not very familiar with this time period, read a background history of the Red Scare first. Doing so will assist you in learning the context for what happens here and help you learn the basics about a few of the groups and personalities associated with the blacklist. In the case of the latter, the topic is so huge that Radosh doesn't have the space to cover many of the important Reds. There is almost nothing here about Lillian Hellman or Dashiell Hammett, for example, and both of those individuals had a lot to do with the influence of communism in film and books. Nevertheless, this book is well worth your time. Read it and remember it the next time Hollywood releases yet another \"we were innocent\" propaganda piece."

      "review_text": "I have always been curious about the influence of Communism in Hollywood.  This book by the Radoshes was perfect for someone like me who was willing to read and learn something about it.  It was far from being a right wing diatribe as two previous reviewers who panned the book stated.  It seemed to be a straight forward analysis of the situation.  I came away from it feeling that despite the diligent efforts of the Communists to use the movies to propagate their views they were far from successful.  The studio heads, whether for economic or patriotic reasons, insured that the obvious propaganda was kept out of their movie productions.    Like C Coffman who wrote the prior review, I wanted to know more about the thinking of the people who were so enamored of the Soviet Union.  It was difficult for me to comprehend how the Hollywood writers continued to support the Soviet Union in the face of clear evidence that Soviet movie writers were being executed in the Soviet Union.  Nor could I fully understand how these Hollywood writers, men (mostly) of immense talent, cowered before their Communist censors.    Finally, the Radoshes put the \"Hollywood Ten\" and the blacklist years in perspective.  They state there were wrongs on both sides and show how the claims of the victims of the blacklisting that they suffered immensely from the Congressional investigations were highly exaggerated.   I came away with the feeling that the ability of those blacklisted to eventually gain work and to use their media to publicize their plight so as to portray themselves as heroes was only possible because they lost.  It would never have been possible for them to show movies about the evil of the blacklisting days had their dreams for a Communist take over of the USA come true since like their fellow professionals in the Soviet Union they would have probably been executed.  Who said you can't win for losing!"

Precisely because of a tendency to close ranks around the defense of semi-myths one needs to zero in from two angles. Here we get the clear effort to indulge in what many would think revisionist propaganda. But despite an obvious bias built in to the account, the tale told is of interest from the conservative angle and sticks to the parts everyone should know, but might not, after the shouting matches over McCarthyism. I really think this book provokes the need for still another book to correct the correction, but in the meantime the information is interesting enough to be quite worth reading. Conservatives get fainting spells about commies in the movie business, but you can read around the lurid conservative passages (not so bad) for some useful corrections of the record, and no doubt much left out."

With about 37 pages of reference material (diaries, speeches, Congressional testimony, biographies, autobiographies, news articles, interviews, etc.), the authors leave no doubt about how these folks cooperated with the Soviet Union in its attempts to \"take over\" Hollywood as a tool in their effort to create a Soviet America. The names of the actors, screen writers, producers etc who were card carrying Communists, fellow travelers, quislings, leftists, and varieties of socialists who made up the Hollywood scene in those days will floor you. You'll have to read the book to find out who they were.  And there were many heroes as well, who finally stood up and took on these cultural saboteurs. You'll never watch movies on the Turner Classic Movies channel the same way again. After you read the book, look closely at the writing and producing credits on these old films.\n\nThe authors draw some connections between the Hollywood leftists of that era and the current crop of leftists in the \"entertainment industry\" today. But that comes at the end of the book and is a very brief section.\n\nThis is a must read book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the Hollywood of the 30's-50's and who here's the sophist leftist pontifications of the Tim Robbins, Barbra Streisands, Bill Mahrs and others. One thing that will strike you  is how well educated, thoughful, well read and articulate both the left and the right were in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. There was intelligent discourse on all sides. They make today's left and right apologists seem like 3d graders reciting \"Dick and Jane\" from memory. That insight was worth the price of the book.\n\nGar"

      "review_text": "I used to wonder why Hollywood ignored the crimes of Soviet Communism, which easily rival the crimes of National Socialism, something they've shown us over and over and over again (certainly understandable). Not one major film has been made showing us the summary executions during Lenin's \"Red Terror,\" the deaths of millions during forced collectivization, the torture and mass murder during Stalin's purges of the late 30's, the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Polish citizens at Katyn, or the horrors of the gulag. But Hollywood has been plenty busy pumping out films on \"McCarthyism\" and the ghastly \"blacklist.\" They're listed in this book: Guilty by Suspicion, The Front, The Way We Were, The Majestic, Marathon Man, The House on Carroll Street, Fellow Traveler, One of Hollywood Ten. This is all propaganda of course. The way they tell it you'd think it was one of the darkest and most tragic eras in human history. McCarthy and his ilk were no saints, and there were certainly excesses, but I don't believe anyone was murdered by McCarthy and HUAC. By contrast tens of millions were murdered in Soviet Russia. Apparently that's no big deal to the fools in Tinseltown who are constantly wringing their hands over \"McCarthyism,\" the blacklist and the persecuted Hollywood ten. These crybabies wouldn't have lasted ONE DAY in the Kolyma forced-labor camps!\n\nThe Radoshes show us that Hollywood back in the 30's and 40's was filled with Soviet-sympathizing Communists who put out propaganda films whitewashing Stalin's mass murders such as The North Star, Song of Russia and Mission to Moscow. While the first two simply glossed over the Stalinist holocaust in Ukraine, the latter film actually GLORIFIED Stalin's secret police and mass purges. Can you believe this? Hollywood actually justified Stalin's killing machine! Think about that the next time some Hollywood leftist whines about the \"horrors\" of \"McCarthyism.\"\n\nWhile no one in Hollywood would dare praise Stalin now, quite a few do embrace other blood-soaked Communist despots. For example, Shirley MacLaine made a pilgrimage to Red China, then reeling in the aftermath of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution, and declared that Mao Tse-tung was a hero of all time. Someone should let Shirley know that her \"hero\" is the biggest mass murderer in history (see \"Mao: The Unknown Story\" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday). And countless Hollywood \"useful idiots\" such as Robert Redford, Danny Glover, Oliver Stone and many, MANY others swoon over that thug Fidel Castro, who has more blood on his hands (15,000 killed) than the hated Augusto Pinochet (3,000 killed). Pinochet's crimes have been the subject of several Hollywood flicks - i.e. Missing, Of Love and Shadows, etc. None have been made on the mass murders of Castro and Mao. To add insult to injury Castroite Robert REDford was executive producer of \"The Motorcycle Diaries,\" a saintly portrayal of Castro's chief executioner Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in his early days. He later went on to murder hundreds of \"counter-revolutionaries\" at La Cabana prison, something that's highly unlikely to be portrayed in the next pro-Che film starring Benicio del Toro.\n\nThe negative reviews are beyond pathetic. McCarthy this... McCarthy that... blah, blah, blah... Of course they can't refute one thing in the book. They prefer myth, not facts. Hollywood was filled with Stalin-worshipping Reds (now Castro-worshipping Pinkos), the Rosenberg's were guilty as charged and Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy. Truth hurts - deal with it!\n\nAlso recommended:\n\nFidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant by Humberto E.

Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party.\n\nThe Radoshes describe the infatuation of \"the Hollywood Party\" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union.  They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the \"Hollywood Ten\" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the \"Ten\" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work.  The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, \"Mission to Moscow.\" This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin's purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed.  Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either \"named names\" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names.  For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration.\n\nIf I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony's long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book.  In the meantime, \"Red Star Over Hollywood\" is well worth reading."

They were Stalin's men and, not to put to fine a point on it, useful idiots in his quest to foment a world-wide communist revolution.\n\nRon Radosh, a communist from childhood, smelled the coffee after he wrote a book trying to prove the innocence of the Rosenberg's only to find that .... they were guilty!  After he said so he was unceremoniously drummed out of the \"leftist corp\" and made to wear a political scarlet letter by his former comrades....some friends they.\n\nRadosh is a PhD in History and a diligent, detailed researcher of the facts i.e. he's interested in the truth and in that sense wherever the facts lead him he will go.  Unfortunately, one doesn't find this trait to be prevalent among political ideaologues be they historians, archeologists, political scientists, reporters, book publishers or video media types.  As an aside, I found it interesting to compare this book with Neil gabler's, \"An Empire of Their Own: How the Jew's Invented Hollywood.\"  The nexus for me is the juxtaposition of the capacity for those who would be relentlessly capitalistic to simultaneously have the ability to be in favor of a world-wide communistic revolution?  Is it a fear of chistianity as an ally of capitalism?  I don't know, but I for one would encourage Radosh to address the subject.  And, he's the man to do it (another book to read as a companion peace would be \"Intellectuals\" by Paul Johnson, the author of \"Modern Times.\")\n\nIt's important to recognize that not all of those in Hollywood, whose lives were ruined by HUAC, were hard-core communists.  Some were just idealistic liberals trying to make a differnce against perceived and real injustices.  To the readers benefit, Radosh teases out these nuances rather well, and anyone interested in this period of history will read this book with great interest.\n\nSetting the record straight is important, but the Hollywood left still clings to a thin tissue when it characterizes this story as a \"fable of innocence destroyed by malice.\"  It's their shakey attempt at moral authority, the kind that underpins a Sean Penn in his critique of Bush's Iraq policy, while he ignores the evils of Sadaam Hussein.\n\nThis book challenges the template of the Hollywood left: that these were brave dissenters standing up for the right to espouse unpopular beliefs against right-wing bullies leading a witch hunt against \"un-American activities;\" that they were victimized political innocents who were skewered by despicable sellouts who named names to save their careers.  Read it, it's good."

But now, corporations need their employees to have a more intense, ongoing academic and technical education, so they provide it themselves via corporate universities. Mark Allen and other experts from ten corporate universities, academic institutions and consultancies contributed chapters to The Corporate University Handbook, a practical, behind-the-scenes manual about designing and managing a corporate university. The goal goes beyond education: corporate universities must train employees and help corporations excel and prosper. This thorough, yet conversational, examination includes best practices, source notes and programs offered by specific companies including Motorola, Toyota, Sun Microsystems and Charles Schwab, in the U.S. and elsewhere. We from getAbstract assign this insightful book as an authoritative homework seminar for corporate university planners or managers"

Many recipes are there, but nothing beats having a book that you can carry with you. Some of these will be making their debut at the Thanksgiving table next week and I can't wait!\n\nThere are some beautiful photos but not a whole lot, but that doesn't take away from the book too much because you can view many of them on the site.\n\nHighly recommended.

It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like \"The Notebook\" or \"The Wedding\" if you want a good romantic read."

I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.\n\nAnd yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.\n\nIf it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.\n\nI guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah"

Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.\n\nWhen Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).\n\nOn the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.\n\nOf course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.\n\nWhile the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.\n\nA very good read"

It was wonderfully told and beautifully written."

There is just enough of a parallel to characters and events in the real world to make the stories\nplausible and just enough romance and action to make it gripping and absorbing. I am already looking forward to the next Gabriel Allon story"

He toots his own horn several times in the book saying how good he is at what he does, but wouldn't someone who knows something about education be able to relay information in a more effective way? This book is entirely unreadable. For example, here is a sentence from page 106. \"Many of the tacit presuppositions guiding intersubjective transactions seem surprisingly incorrigible, even surprisingly inaccessible to conscious reflection.\" What exactly does this mean? I'll tell you what I think this book is. I think that Mr. Bruner is trying to impress people, while trying to make them feel stupid. If he has something to say, he should just say it! He buries whatever point he has in pretentious words such as \"immutable,\" Pontogenetically,\" and \"Hermeneutic.\" If you are buying this book on Amazon, I suggest you also purchase the biggest dictionary they sell"

I was afraid that I might not enjoy it if it was  pure fiction.  I was wrong.  The book is a very, very funny satire of the Washington scene, whch has not changed.  It is also a tale of real angst and heartbreak.\n\nWhat is basically a sad story has delicious veins of humor, wistfulness, sadness, prosaic pragmatism, and real recipes marbling through it, all of which magically meld into a satisfying whole: but that is what a work of art can do."

In this roman a clef, the chatacter based on cheating-husband Bernstein is called \"Mark Feldman.\"  Today I read Ephron's admission, in the Huffington Post blog, that living with the knowledge of Deep Throat's true identity was a \"very heavy burden.\"\n\nSo, was her estranged husband's character name inspired consciously by Deep Throat's name, or subconsciously?\n\nI don't really need an answer to that question.

The pie I threw at Mark made a terrific mess, but a blueberry pie would have been even better, since it would have permanently ruined his new blazer.......so Rachel Samstat muses on her marriage to Mark Feldman.\n\nNora Ephron's thinly disguised account of her marriage to famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein is laugh-out-loud funny in parts, though if you're looking for advice on how to save your marriage, the aforementioned tidbit is typical of the advice you'll get.\n\nRachel is seven months pregnant with her second child when she learns her husband is not only having an affair with a mutual acquaintance, but has fallen in love with her. This indignity is compounded because, due to Rachel's advanced preganancy, she can't even date. She does manage one innocent flirtation on the subway which, in true slapstick fashion, leads to armed robbery. Ah, the perils of life flitting between New York and Washington.\n\nShort and savvy, this contemporary 80's novel is peppered with recipes since Rachel is a cookbook editor and host of her own cooking show. A collapsing marriage doesn't seem suitable for high-level comedy, but Nora Ephron makes it work and will have you laughing all the way to the bitter end."

What good is that you'll learn how much of our world is being controlled/destroyed by people and regulations that you've never even hear of or about.  If everyone read this book and spoke up, we might actually preserve this democracy and live better lives.  We'd understand what in our democracy and world is going wrong and have some ideas as to how to fix this."

      "review_text": "Actually, you can't according to Greg Palast who challenges the results of the 2000 election in which he charges Jeb Bush with instituting his own style of Jim Crow laws to ensure that his brother would get elected. It's unique because time and again conservative papers and organizations conducted studies to show that Bush would have won anyway. Palast concedes that a recount of the actual votes would back that up. But Palast is concerned with the voters who were not allowed to vote, and the votes that were not counted.\n\nHe charges that more than 57,000 law-abiding citizens were improperly labeled as felons, and were kept from voting in Florida. These were almost all African-American who universally vote Democrat. There was an 80% criteria for finding a match of felon names. The company Choice Point started with a 90% match, but the state told them that was too high! They were told to make it an 80% match.\n\nSo, a felon named John Johnson Jr. would also keep a law-abiding citizen named Jack Johnson or John O. Johnson from voting too. When did the state of Florida inform these people that they were on a felons list and could not vote? They didn't, even though they were supposed to give ample notice to allow any mistake to be corrected.\n\nThe company that got the job of putting the fix in, Choice Point was awarded a multi-million dollar contract over other companies that would have done the same job better for literally pennnies per voter. Florida decided to pay much more per voter with Choice Point.\n\nNow here's the lie. Choice Point said that they did not use race as a criterion, but it was used as a matching criterion. Presto! Even with the disproportionate number of Blacks in the prison population, Palasts states that the number kept from voting was statistically way out of proportion to the number of felons.\n\nJust to ensure the outcome, the voting machines in Black neighborhoods were fewer and older than the ones in White neighborhoods. In some cases 18% of the Black vote was thrown out for one reason or another while in White neighborhoods were 1 to 2% was the norm. This was the perfect scam since anyone knows that Blacks would overwhelmingly vote for Gore, and the Whites would have had a large voting block for Bush.\n\nFlorida's official reason was that the law prohibited felons from voting. They didn't want any felons to try to vote. (?)Palast asks, what felon wants to vote so badly that he would risk going back to jail for it? Good point! Not one person in Florida was arrested for voting twice.\n\nThen, there were the roving republican goon squads who went to wherever the recount was attempted to intimidate the recount process.\n\nPalast accuses the press of doing nothing or investigating nothing about a national election that was obviously rigged. When he offered the story to CBS, a network that has long since cowed to conservative screams of bias, they refused. Why? The CBS executive called the state of Florida to verify the story. They, the state, assured them there was nothing to it? Isn't that like asking the fox if he can be trusted to protect the henhouse? Palast gained a large audience in Europe bringing this story to light. It received almost no attention here, and when it did, it was way after the election.\n\nThis was the most important part of the book for me. While I enjoyed his commentary on Wackenhut and other exposes, this one was the most riveting. It scares me. This isn't supposed to happen in the US. That is why I recommend this book and especially his newer one, \"Armed Madhouse.\"\n\nPalast proves by showing leaked documents, pictures and statistic improbability that this and the 2004 election were stolen by electronic ballot stuffing. I thought this was only supposed to happen in a third world nation.\n\nShouldn't someone go to jail for this? Shouldn't we be able to count on it"

      "review_text": "Devour this book in small bites, or you're likely to choke on the raw truth of it.  Between these covers, Palast demonstrates repeatedly why EVERYone today needs to resist the sound byte mentality thrust upon us and pay attention to the facts.  While I'm in no position to verify the accuracy of some of his investigations, the policies and actions carried out by the Bush Administration since this book was first written illustrate the accuracy of most of Palast's claims in broad daylight.\n\nIf only the mainstream media were paying attention.  Then again, the mainstream media is owned by corporations that make money selling fluff and not upsetting too many of their readers, viewers, and/or listeners.  So why should we expect otherwise?\n\nOccasionally, Palast pushes the envelope on his ability to actually KNOW the motivations and responsibilities (blame) of various people he is writing about here.  More often than not, however, he simply puts forth so many facts, and connects so many dots for us, that it's difficult to not come to many of the same conclusions he has.  And, again, the actions of the Bush Administration -- and various members and associates of the Bush family -- have born out many of those conclusions over the past few years.\n\nRead this book and compare it with news stories from the past 5-to-6 years and, if you have done any digging at all, you will quickly see how scary the truth really can be.  Hopefully, you'll also see how important it is now to stand up, speak out, and fight for genuine middle class America and those folks even less fortunate than us.  One thing you can put money on, our current government sure isn't looking out for them...or you.\n\nGood luck to us all"

I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.\n\nThis book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing.  I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it.  But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did.  I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat."

However, the two friends are quickly realizing how hard it truly is to be out on their own, with no one there to support them. They get day jobs that totally run them down, and are, how should we put this...totally boring! So Lula and Jeff decide to spice things up by entering a local band contest that could get them televised and everything. The only problem, is that the newest hottie Lula's been hooking up with, Enrique, has also entered the band contest, and is her band's toughest competition. Sure, Enrique is totally mesmerizing to look at, but Lula's not sure if she can trust him with her secrets...or her heart.\n\nAs a HUGE fan of the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series, I never pass up the opportunity to read their latest releases, which is why SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE quickly caught my eye. Suzanne Weyn & Diana Gonzalez have created an excellent book for anyone looking for an easy read during their Spring Break or Summer Vacation. The characters found in SOUTH BEACH SIZZLE are upbeat, fun, and all feature unique personalities. The romance is cute, and will definitely appeal to pre-teen and teenage girls; while the band competition will appeal to aspiring musicians of the female gender. Overall, this was a wonderful addition to the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series, that will be enjoyed by all.\n\nErika Sorocco\nBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape"

Myself, I just looked at the care that Phaidon press took while publishing this, from its rough artistic pages to the in-depth look at contemporary drawing and knew instantly that this was a survey book that I would be opening time and again for years to come.\n\nThe artists that are covered here are not neccisarily unknown. Pettibon, Peyton, and other long standing luminaries stand along side scores of other artists that I had never heard of. What it is, is a survey of non-illustration/often conceptualy based drawing that is occuring today be the artist known or obscure.\n\nIf you are into drawing, this is a must have book. One thing to keep in mind is that the format presented here is pretty much along the lines of Vitamin P and the three 'Cream' books. I think all four of these ranged from good to great, if you disagree with this sentiment, you might not like 'Vitamin D.'"

      "review_text": "David Kennedy's \"Freedom from Fear,\" the 9th volume of the Oxford History of the United States, is a generally exceptionally well researched history covering from the Great Depression to the end of World War II. In this book, Kennedy offers a summary and a synthesis of research by dozens of historians, as well as giving his own personal interpretations of key events and individuals.\n\nI believe most of David Kennedy's interpretations and judgments are well reasoned. However, I disagree with his deemphasis upon the major decline in the stock market between late 1929 - 1931 as one of the main causes of the Great Depression.\n\nEven more so I dissent very strongly with David Kennedy's suggestion the Roosevelt administration should have tried harder to avoid war with Japan by essentially appeasing Japanese aggression against China. To quote from his book, Kennedy writes on page 513: \"Why not acquiesce, however complainingly, in the Japanese action in China, reopen at least limited trade with Japan...\" Given the fact that Japanese aggression and atrocities in China were as bad or worse as Germany's in Europe by late 1941, I find Kennedy's opinion morally reprehensible.\n\nIn general, this is a very good book, covering social, economic, political and military history of the era. However, don't read \"Freedom from Fear,\" expecting to learn much about cultural history in the United States between the Great Depression and World War II."

      "review_text": "Freedom From Fear is an exhaustive study of America and its people during two of this country's most defining periods, the Great Depression and World War II. David Kennedy packs a lot of information in this very substantial book while maintaining a very readable study of this important period in American history. While the book is geared towards the general reader, it doesn't lack for analysis, which makes this both an accessible and very informative book.\n\nThis period in question covers 1929-1945, which in the broad spectrum of time seems to be very insignificant, but in reality was anything but insignificant. From the early stages of the depression in the late 1920s during the Hoover Administration, to the Atomic bombs used against Japan in 1945 during the Truman Presidency which ended the war in the Pacific, this books covers many important people and events in both the social, political and economic realms of American life.\n\nThe Depression years are the focus of the first part of the book (obviously) and delves with insight into what issues led to the crisis, how the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations confronted the crisis, how the American people were affected by the economic difficulties and how the New Deal was both successful and unsuccessful. Hoover was actually quite proactive in the fight to bring some economic stability to the nation, contrary to what many believe, Hoover was an extremely capable man, but perhaps not open minded enough to try new and far larger objectives as Franklin Roosevelt proved during his presidency.\n\nThe New Deal is obviously the focus of much attention as it should be, but while it did do much to bring about some major legislation in the relief and reforming aspects of the New Deal's objectives, it wasn't quite the panacea to complete economic recovery, only World War II would bring that about. I think I'm summarizing Kennedy's view on the New Deal as accurate as possible without getting to overwhelmed by the nature of this broad program. There is so much covered that it's hard to summarize both concisely and precisely.\n\nThe turmoil in Europe caused by Hitler's regime, the strong isolationist sentiments that so pervaded the attitudes in this country before Pearl Harbor, and the eventual American intervention and allied efforts to defeat the German and Japanese powers are all part of the next phase in the period covered in this book. Kennedy is able to effectively describe the many facets surrounding America's entry and involvement in the Second World War from the mobilization of the country's industrial and manpower-womanpower supply, to the different strategies developed and implemented to win the war on the European and Pacific fronts, and the people who played such important roles in the conflict.\n\nThe major battles fought, the successes and setbacks of military and political strategies, the changing nature on the American homefront that would improve the standard of living for so many Americans after World War II are all covered. Difficult subjects aren't left out either, including the internment of Japanese-Americans, the status of African Americans during the war years, and the general brutality of the war itself from both sides, most especially in the Pacific Theater of the war.\n\nThis book is all-encompassing, well-written, yet very analytical when it needs to be. Quite rare. Maybe some of his conclusions are open for debate, which is not unusual when writing history. He at times can be critical of individuals for decisions made or not made, lost opportunities and the likes, and that should be discussed. He does disagree with the theory, I suppose advocated by some, that Roosevelt wanted Pearl Harbor to be attacked or knew it would happen. Some sections of the book require a good working knowledge of certain issues, but overall it is well-written. I've studied this period before, but I found this book very rewarding in that I also learned quite a bit I knew little or nothing about. I would highly recommend this book"

      "review_text": "Despite the newfound popularity of social history, and ethnic history, and gender history, it's nice to just sit down and sink my teeth into a nice old-fashioned survey history of America. Heavy on political history, Freedom from Fear tells the story of America during the Great Depression and the Second World War. It is a survey, but it is broad and deep, running more than eight hundred pages to cover about sixteen years. David Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning text is worth every penny.\n\nGiven the two broad subjects, it's not surprising that the book is essentially divided into two sections. In the first, Kennedy takes us on a journey into the downward spiral of the American economy during the Hoover years.  Maligned by history, Hoover could have been a better president than he was, but events overwhelmed him. Even his great success in life prior to winning the White House did not prepare him for the immensity of the task. Indeed, possibly no one could have handled it. But Roosevelt is seen here to have been up to the challenge. Not of actually fixing the problems. Kennedy is quite frank in his evaluation of Roosevelt's New Deal programs and his performance in such matters. In many places Roosevelt could have done better, perhaps by adopting a more internationalist approach to economics, or by not antagonizing and demoralizing the business community.\n\nMore broadly, we see the decline in living conditions, and at the same time the rise of labor unions and government programs both useful and not. We see the uneven performance of the economy in various parts of the country, and the desperate mobility that sometimes resulted. We see a country scared and in turmoil, unsure of itself and its destiny.\n\nBut though the Depression dragged on, waxing and waning, events elsewhere in the world did not stop to wait. Though America was among the hardest hit of countries, it was not the worst behaving on the international scene. Rumbles of war began in Europe and in Asia, and America stood aside hoping to avoid it all. Of course this was not to be, and with the Japanese attack America found itself thrust into total war. The economy was finally freed of the doldrums by massive war spending. The people were roused from stupor by the drumbeats of battle. Alliances solidified, and the enemies were targeted. And America joined the war in its own unique way. It could never be said that America takes no advantage of its industrial strength. While the countries of Europe dealt with the situation forced upon them, America armed itself and prepped for battle. It built its forces. It provided machinery and equipment to allies. It transformed factories to a war production mode. Industrial geniuses, pumped with cash, streamlined methods of mass production on a scale never imagined before. And newer and better weapons came to be. More than in most books, Kennedy makes it clear that the American effort in war was a mechanized and deliberate effort. When the Western front opened, it was run with industrial clarity of purpose.\n\nIf there is a dominant theme in Freedom From Fear, it is that America runs on its commerce.  The business of America really is business. With or without government regulation, with or without organized labor, it is economy that runs Kennedy's America. But with such sweeping vision and engaging style, the reader could do much worse to learn about America in the interesting times than to read this gripping account"

      "review_text": "There is much to like in David Kennedy's history of the United States during the 1930s and early 1940s.  His book is an excellent overview of the political and economic history of the period.  His examination of the New Deal is both insightful and judicious, while his description of America in the Second World War is gripping and informative.  Throughout the book Kennedy offers a penetrating analysis of events, discerning approaches that reshaped many of the fundamental relations that existed between the American people and their government.\n\nYet in some respects the volume is something of a disappointment.  The book is a contribution to the superb \"Oxford History of the United States\" series, which has set a high standard with its earlier volumes.  It is by this measure that Kennedy's book is wanting; it is hardly the comprehensive examination of its topic that the earlier volumes were, as his focus on politics and economics gives short shrift to American culture and society during the period.  Moreover, his prose often seems excessively grandiose.  Efforts to create soaring metaphors often become too labored and fall flat, making for a stark contrast with the clear descriptions and jargon-free analysis they buttress.\n\nNevertheless, Kennedy's achievement with this book is impressive.  He has provided a well-written account of America's efforts to deal with some of the greatest challenges that the nation ever faced.  Readers seeking a history of the period would be hard pressed to find a better and more readable book with which to start"

Bush preparing to undo the last vestiges of the New Deal, whether you agree with him or not I can't think of a better time, and reason for reading this remarkable study by David Kennedy.\n\nKennedy debunks much of what the remnants of history have left most of us about Herbert Hoover. I think this was the most surprising part of the book because everything I had read, seen, or heard up until now left only negative impressions of the man. I have a both a new respect for Hoover as a man, dour though he was, and a clearer understanding of why he failed as a politician. I also have a fresh reminder of how nothing is really original - FDR borrowed much of the New Deal from Hoover.  But where Hoover couldn't make the ideological leap from good ideas that were to be voluntary only with only minimal government assistance, FDR was amenable to trying anything, including transformational ideas such as mandatory business compliance with Federal regulation, an evening-up of the playing field between business (which had corporatized) and labor (which until FDR hadn't the power to do the same) and labor, to massive government spending. Although FDR didn't understand Keyensian economics, he nevertheless proved the theory.\n\nFDR defined the \"general welfare\" clause of the Constitution, and left a legacy that has affected every single one of us ever since, and continues to do so today.\n\nBeside the in-depth look at the Great Depression, Kennedy also provides a survey of WWII, debunking many more myths along the way, and exposing the beginnings of the cold war in FDR & Churchill's unkept promises to Stalin about the opening of a second front in Europe.\n\nI consider this a \"must read\" for anyone who considers him/herself interested in American History"

Naturally, the Great Depression and World War II are too vast for any one volume, and if one has an interest in any specific topic, personage, or chapter, the author has provided an unrivalled bibliography to kick off the quest.\n\nThe professor's writing is simple and straightforward and he knows how to keep his narrative moving at a good clip. This is essential in such a lengthy document. All in all, I'd classify it as a tour de force, essential reading for those interested in the Depression and the War.\n\nAfter the wonderfully enjoyable read, the book sits well on the shelf and comes down quickly for solid reference. This is definitely a five star effort."

Kennedy portrays FDR as powerful and willing for change. He was an inspiring character for those during the Depression. Further into the book, Kennedy devotes his research to the New Deal and the effects it had on the Depression. Kennedy did go into detail about the effects, but he should have researched more about the causes of the Depression. Even though this book seems to drag on at parts because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was Kennedy's writing style that made the book hard to put down.

      "review_text": "Drucker outlines lessons that management can learn from the changing world economy and population.\n\n1. Management is not just business management, but is the ability to take advantage of opportunities in sectors of the economy that are likely to experience growth in the future, like education, the professions, and healthcare.\n2. Recognize that there is not one ideal way to organize an enterprise.  Both \"team\" organization and the \"CEO cult of personality\" have their shortcomings.  It can be difficult for teams to make decisions effectively and popular CEO's must have successors.  You must find the right balance of organization that fits your company's business needs.\n3. There is no one way to organize employees.  You need to lead workers rather than manage employees.  This is because management increasingly does not know the areas of expertise that employees possess, and employees are now seeking interesting and rewarding work.\n4. National boundaries and regional markets will become less defining factors of the companies boundaries.  Innovations in an industry don't necessarily come from within the industry anymore.  Further, national governments will be less able to protect local industries from facing the competitiveness of the global industry leaders.  Global competitiveness must become a strategic goal for the business.\n\nDrucker also outlines the economic consequences of the declining birthrate in the developed countries.  A declining birthrate means that the working population will become progressively older.  New relationships must be forged with older workers, especially knowledge workers.  Companies that attract and retain knowledge workers past retirement age will gain a significant competitive advantage.\n\nManagers must become Change Leaders, who direct inevitable change in a controlled and orderly fashion.  Managers must look to extending the lifespan of their companies and approaching change as a source of business opportunity."

      "review_text": "Peter Drucker, an editorial columnist for the Wall Street Journal, a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world's most respected management thinkers. His books, over 20 of them, have been called the \"landmarks of the managerial profession\" by the Harvard Business Review.  He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought.  In 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams.'  In 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers' concept.\n\nHere Drucker lays out six of the 'new' challenges facing the businesses of the early 21st century.\n\nFirst involves management's new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people.  There is no 'one size fits all' approach.  The method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is 'value.'  Employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers, 'persuaded' rather than 'ordered.'\n\nThe next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape.  The collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for.  Global competitiveness is a must for survival.  Performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just short-term gains in order to inspire and commit 'knowledge workers' to their mission.\n\nThird is becoming a change leader.  Educate others that change equals opportunity.  Regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results.  Enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company.  Study what is working or not in the market with other companies. Don't confuse motion with action.\n\nFourth are the information challenges.  The purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action.  Success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer.  Information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity, competence and allocation of scarce resources information.\n\nThe fifth challenge lies in vitalizing 'knowledge workers' into high productivity.  Attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow.  Differing from manual laborers, knowledge workers carry the 'means of production' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work.\n\nThe sixth challenge is managiing ourself (ourselves).  The biggest possible increase in production lies here.  Intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance.  Concentrate on your strengths.  Avoid trying to change yourself.  Ask yourself what your strengths are.  Determine how you work.  Do you like to work alone?  Would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker?  What are your values?  This type of questioning will help determine where you belong.  Most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once.  You must learn what makes 'you' tick.\n\nFive Stars"

      "review_text": "This book is first published in 1999.  Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc.  The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages.  The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.  It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century.  Concepts like \"individuals will outlive their organization\", \"how to defines one's goal and contribution\" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD"

      "review_text": "Regrettably, Peter Drucker passed away just a few days after I picked up this 1999 release. At the age of 89 (in 1999), Drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business. His chapter on \"Information Challenges,\" at 38 pages one of the longest in the book, Drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data. Few companies exemplify this better than Wal-Mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain.\n\nPerhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer, Drucker recognized that \"more and more people in the workforce - and most knowledge works - will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES.\" (Emphasis in original.) Drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives, something he himself did.\n\nAs Drucker put it in his introduction, the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century. With this book, as with all of his others, Drucker may be gone physicially, but his thoughts will live on for many decades to come.\n\nJerr"

I would rate this book highly, along with one of my favorite grief authors, thanatologist Alan Wolfelt (e.g. Understanding Your Grief books).  Harper Neeld seamlessly combines her painful, personal story with factual, helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks I have read on widowhood.  I used the introspective questions with my grief therapist, who liked the book so much that she borrowed it and used it for a class she taught."

Elixabeth put the most important step first \"To experience and express grief fully.\"  There are hundreds of ways to run away from grief, but it is necessary \"to feel it to heal it.\" I was given the best advice by a friend who said to \"lean into the pain.\" The second choice \"To endure with patience,\" has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself.

Escoffier defined the benchmark for classic French cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots, much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music.  You can find essences of classic French cooking in even the lowliest diner fare.\nMuch of what is taught in culinary schools today is based on Escoffier's tecniques.  By purchasing this book, you are getting this information straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak, rather than second-hand with the possibility of influences instilled by the instructor skewing the information.\nI believe the most surprising section of the book is that dealing with treatments for various types of game.  This section contains comprehensive instructions for dealing with a wide variety of game from buffalo to venison that are very useful today.\nI have noticed in at least two places, Escoffier appears to contradict himself. I believe this is due to the problems with translation, and if you follow carefully what he is saying, you can figure out the correct meaning"

There are no pictures, none are really needed. Some recipes do make a gallon of sauce, rather than just enough for a couple or foursome to enjoy, so scale back or freeze a lot!\n\nWhy read it?\n\nFor me, it's living culinary history, and the recipes can make one drool with their simplicity or lushness...It's the source of thousands of \"tried and true\" recipes, unsullied by \"fusion\" fads or foolishness, where a \"souffle\" defines anything from a pancake to a meringue topping, and even \"molten chocolate brownies\" are also called \"souffles\" by food knowledge-challenged \"writers\" who apparently do not bother to read a recipe, nor have made or tasted a true souffle.\n\nI read the name of a tasty dish at a restaurant, and later see how closely it adheres to the recipes of almost a hundred years ago, and surprisingly there's little variation when cooked by a traditional French trained chef. There are many pointers on how to prepare things, unusual combinations to try, how to tie a roast, ... all sorts of tricks of the trade that are passed from one chef to the next, and not found in Joy of Cooking or most celebrity chef recipes.\n\nIf you are serious about learning and appreciating French cuisine, don't need your hand held while evaluating or following a recipe, and appreciate access to thousands of classic recipes collected in one book, then this is THE source and the book for you"

I currently live and work in SF, and enjoyed listening to the book on my mp3 player while commuting in the MUNI subways.  True to form, Winchester only spends a small amount of time on the catastrophic event itself, and instead develops the events which lead up to the event -- first in a geological perspective, and second in a sociological one.\n\nUnfortunately, this book does not come together as well as his book on Krakatoa.  Being a current San Franciscan, I found his history of the city lacking.  His conclusions about the current Christian revival as being strongly influenced by the quake is tenuous, but his points about its pyschological impact on society are well-received.\n\nThe best parts of the books were the descriptions of the science and history of plate tectonics, as well as the detailed historical descriptions of the quake itself.  If you're at all interested in the quake, you should pick this up, and also try his other books"

      "review_text": "\"A Crack in the Edge of the World\" is a great read that I especially recommend to all whom live, have lived or who have simply just visited the San Francisco region of California.  To all these individuals, it would only be some troglodyte who has not at least heard of the great earthquake of 1906.  This book covers that momentous year and much more as well.\n\nI had the good fortune of living in San Francisco for two years in the mid 1980s and experienced one relatively small earthquake.  These tremors from below are no laughing matter.  They are terrifying.  One can only guess at the magnitude of the quake of 1906.  Yet Californians are so blas�.  Are they foolhardy or simply ignorant?  I think the former as no one could be unaware of the brittleness of the ground on which they tread.\n\nSimon Winchester's book provides the reader with a brief history of plate tectonics, the precise events of 18 April 1906 as well as some ruminations about the future.  He puts this all in perspective and wonderfully entertains the reader along the way.  His analysis of Portola Valley as a \"deeply dangerous place (that is) liable to be destroyed at any moment\" is courageously and provocatively true.  I have visited this town many times and been simply amazed at how people can deny the very obvious fact that there lives rest upon a ticking time bomb.  No doubt his further view that \"many of its houses and offices deserve to be evacuated and abandoned\" will be ignored.  In the long run, he will inevitably be proved prescient.\n\nWinchester probably says much that people, particularly those who reside in California, don't want to hear.  However, he is no crackpot.  Rather he is a writer who deserves to be read by a wider audience.  This book is a great work that I recommend to all....and that includes the residents of California."

This being the centennial of the event, there have been a lot of books produced about it, but I had heard good things about Winchester and his writing, so this is the one I picked.  I'll have to find another one to read that has the info I was looking for.  I was looking for a book filled with stories about the people who lived through it and how it affected their lives.  I wanted to read about families separated and united, romances and businesses.  I wanted to read about human emotion.  This is not the book for that, but that's not to say that it doesn't have merit.  I learned about plate tectonics, the formation of the world, the settlement of the American West, earthquakes in the Midwest, and much more, but only 50-75 pages of the book are actually devoted to the earthquake and fire in San Francisco, and once the fire it put out, the book quickly ends.  There is a little discussion about the rebuilding, but mostly just to disparage the effort.  Winchester throws in lots of footnotes with interesting asides and more annoyingly lots of Latin phrases and oversized words that show off his intelligence but do little to enhance the storytelling.  His research is excellent, and I did learn quite a bit, enough to sleep well in my stable state of Wisconsin and ensure that I'll never visit California"

      "review_text": "Geologist turned journalist Simon Winchester is carving out his own fine niche in popular science writing, of which \"A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906\" is a very good example. However, his latest book is one which rambles on a bit too long, instead of trying to captivate the reader as successfully as he did in his previous books \"Krakatoa\" and \"The Map That Changed The World\". For example, though he offers a fine chapter on plate tectonics and its bearing on the occurrences and intensity of earthquakes  (\"From Plate to Shining Plate\"), it tends to meander as much as the rivers and lakes he describes whose courses and shapes changed after the New Madrid, Missouri earthquakes near the end of 1811, transformed more into his own personal odyssey of exploration into the earthquake's history, than a lucid, mesmerizing account of North America's tectonic history (For a more lucid, better written account, one should turn to John McPhee's books, most notably those comprising his \"Annals of the Former World\".). In a similar vein, his chapters on the San Francisco earthquake and its immediate aftermath are a huge morass of facts and figures whose inclusion may have been due more to offer dramatic impact, than add some interesting insight on the 1906 earthquake itself. But to his credit, Winchester offers some fascinating nuggets of information, most notably in his descriptions of seismologist Frank Richter's personality and the origins of the earthquake magnitude scale which bears Richter's name. However, if you are interested in a sprawling, occasionally mesmerizing account of the 1906 earthquake, then \"A Crack in the Edge of the World\" may indeed be of interest to you, the potential customer and reader"

      "review_text": "I am always sad to finish one of Mr. Winchester's books; they are definitely not to be read in one sitting and because they stay with you for so long, it is as if you have finished a memorable semester by the time you put the book back on the shelf.  True, they are discursive--but wonderfully so, and \"Crack\" more than most.  Indeed, the cover serves as a hint of things to come--folded into a cover is a surprisingly large poster--just as the ideas of this book are much larger than they first appear.\n\nIf one truly wishes to understand the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the geological, sociological, historical and other effects that rippled outward in time from the central namesake event, one must prepare for a journey.  As with any great journey, some parts are better and more interesting than others--but the combined and lasting understanding of the science and history to be derived from reading this book is unequalled.  Suffice it to say that upon completion of \"Crack\" the reader understands earthquakes and their impact upon our world.\n\nThink of your favorite lecturer in college and you get a sense for Winchester's style--a style wryly self-referenced as bloviation.  His diversions are often entirely unexpected (and not always entirely supportable) but enjoyable and thought-provoking nonetheless.  He communicates a sense of the joy of scholarship and discovery--being able to drive up to Alaska, for example, just to see how the big pipe fared in the massive Denali quake; being able to utterly discredit the worthless dreck rushed into print shortly after the disaster; pointing to that most Californian of attitudes--the stunning failure to take advantage of the opportunity to re-create San Francisco according to a grand master plan, a mistake echoed in Southern California's loss of the redcars in favor of freeways.\n\nWhat Mr. Winchester desperately needs is a format that allows him more graphical content.  Something along the old TimeLife science series or the Dorling Kindersley formats.  Anyone that can work opera, immigration, Arizona's meteor crater, Watson Lake bashing, fault finding (geologic) and roadtrips into an interesting book about earthquakes needs all the resources he can get.  Give the man a series and run him around the world like Michael Palin"

A lot of his personal narrative is a bit rambling at times, but the overall theme of the book, the journey across the North American tectonic plate is a good one (though I think John McPhee does it better in his book \"Annals of the Former World\"). Winchester again displays an uncanny ability to make the complex (plate tectonics) understandable. I only wished he'd gone into a bit more detail like he did on \"Krakatoa\".\n\nStill, I enjoyed the book and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about the San Francisco earthquake, and the science behind why it happened then and will happen again"

One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding"

      "review_text": "And the Band Played On is an act of phenomenal research and writing, and a very frightening book on many levels because of the political wrangling, political bumbling, and political disregard for a medical crisis which cost the lives of so many, the scientific in-fighting which slowed medical break throughs and sacrificed lives, and the insanity of national agencies which were supposed to be saving lives, but which in this case knowingly risked the lives of many either because they didn't want to do the work, didn't want to spend the money, or didn't want to anger certain political groups.  Gay men were deemed to be utterly dispensable by so many.\n\nIt's the sign of a good book when it brings out strong emotions.  This book provoked in me anger, rage, confusion, compassion, sadness, and tears.  I wish I could thank all those, like Don Francis, Dr. Michael Gottlieb, Dr. Selma Dritz, Marc Conant, Dr. Dale Lawrence, Paul Volberding, and Dr. Arye Rubenstein, who tried so hard, against such overwhelming odds, to save lives quickly.  I would also chastise President Ronald Reagan and Merve Silverman and give Margaret Heckler and Bob Gallo a piece of my mind -- the skunks!\n\nI am thankful that there are politicians like Orrin Hatch and people behind the scenes like Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones.  Though he was woefully slow in responding I'm grateful for the response of C. Everett Koop and that once having made his stand he never wavered and took it to the media wherever he could.\n\nRandy Shilts did an excellent job of showing the culture in the United States and France and the politics in the medical and scientific communities and the political posture and arena during the 1980s.  He also humanized the crisis by following many of the patients from onset of medical problems to death (Enno Poersch, Gary Walsh, Frances Borchelt, Bill Kraus, and Gaetan Dugas) and by following the doctors and scientists in their fight to discover the properties of this terrible disease and conquer it.  It was enlightening and helpful to have the book structured as a time line.\n\nThe amount and variety of research done for this book is astounding, requiring Shilts to conduct hundreds of interviews and read millions of pages of articles and medical material.  In reading this book, my education has been enhanced and my life is more full and forever changed.\n\nIt is a great tragedy that AIDS killed Randy Shilts as it had killed so many other innocents, and that as I write this there is still no cure for AIDS.  As far as I can tell, it is again being largely ignored by governments and the medical community.  Where will the next Randy Shilts, Bill Kraus, and Dr. Gottlieb and the other saviors come from--and will they come soon enough?"

      "review_text": "Good stories work on several levels; they are multi-dimensional views of the same event. To honor the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I reread Randy Shilts's groundbreaking work, which was published a mere six years after the reports of a `gay cancer' first surfaced at the CDC.\n\nIt is still an intense and provocative book that reveals the social and political motives that became both pathways and obstacles for finding a cause and a cure for the killer disease. Shilts, who tested positive during the research for his book, but said he didn't ask for the results until his writing was finished, nonetheless brings an emotional bias to his research. His regret (he engaged in many of the risky sexual practices against which he rails) runs like an electric current throughout and gives his story a kind of missionary momentum and zeal.\n\nAs a result, \"And the Band Played On\" survives as a masterpiece of nonfiction storytelling because it is as much about a human disease as it is about the human condition including themes of betrayal and sacrifice, fear and love, exuberance and panic, loss and redemption - contrasts that the play \"Angels in America\" perfectly captured when it premiered in 1991.\n\nShilts explored AIDS in America as a disease of both body and spirit - seemingly through the prism of his own tragic circumstances. It's a timeless and priceless view."

      "review_text": "The sexual revolution is over, wrote an old revolutionist named P.J. O'Rourke, and the microbes won.  This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war.\nAuthor Randy Shilts tells the story of all-night all-day playgrounds on America's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses.  AIDS wasn't the gay plague, Shilts reports.  It was the 4th or 5th gay plague, nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of Stonewall's closet.  Gay sexual activists took it for granted, writes Shilts, that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases.  When the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early 1980s didn't magically appear, sexual athletes did what any normal hot-blooded Americans would do:  they blamed Reagan.\nMr. Shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game.  His scorn for bath house behaviors & for blood banks is loud & clear; cheap-shotting of Reagan is muted.  Reagan, after all, had other wars and a rocky post-Carter economy on his hands.  By the time Mr. Shilts' book became a tv mini-movie, however, Reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain.  If only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name, thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved ... after all, we are now told, we all have AIDS.  (Ponder what Reagan might have said if he'd been convinced by Koop or somebody to speak the name of AIDS in 1982 or 1983:  Well, as your mothers probably should have told you ... Reagan, being a realist, understood that AIDS in America was/is overwhelmingly a behavioral disease.)\nRead And the Band Played On in tandem with Dragon Within the Gates by Stephen Joseph, former health commissioner of New York City and former Clintonista.  These books, together, are the best war reporting of the recent past.  They show how microbes won the war, and how microbes then won civil rights."

This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.\n\nEVERYONE ignored it. The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a \"gay disease.\" Gay men didn't want to discuss that it \"might\" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldn't even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.\n\nBy the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease.\n\nThis book made me cry. The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, \"Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people.\" How absolutely disgusting.\n\nThis is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring. They didn't give up. No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted. Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994. God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US. What the heck is wrong with this country? Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long? What's so stinking WRONG with us?\n\nAnother book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years. How many people did they kill by doing that? Far, far too many. We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program. This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn't think that was possible.\n\nGod bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS"

      "review_text": "Shilts' great book shows us how much of the AIDS related suffering of the last twenty years could so easily have been avoided. The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not.\n\nIn between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years.\n\nBecause the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain.  Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared.\n\nRock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer!\n\nBut even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind.\n\nThe bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus.\n\nAnd, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death.\n\nShilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's.\n\nOn the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity."

I read this book while attending graduate school, years after reading Zinn's fascinating People's history of the United States. Johnson's interrogation of the polemic characters, social movements, and various ideologies provides readers with a brilliant but conservative perspective that is trenchant and well-detailed. Although I consider myself a moderate liberal, I was intrigued on how Johnson describes certain historical figures, For instances, unlike Zinn, Johnson reveres business potentates, such as Rockefeller and Drew, for their philanthropic activities in the late ninetieth century. He is exceedingly critical of Thomas Jefferson, but he adulates Andrew Jackson for his gallantry during the Battle of New Orleans. I recommend students, scholars, general readers, and history buffs, to read this thought-provoking book with Zinn's People's History to procure a well-balanced understanding of American history and the people and ideas that shaped this great nation."

      "review_text": "While I wouldn't recommend that my students read only Paul Johnson's work on US History, I would definitely recommend that they read it in accompaniment to their texts.  Johnson is rightly to be credited for providing a more balanced and optimistic view of the American people/government than is prevalent in the majority of publishing firms today.  He does not shy away from criticism where it is due, but neither is he afraid to assert honor where honor is due--even if it means offending some politically correct ears.\n\nWhile I agree that he can be classified as a conservative, I would also note that this is not a \"conservative's conservative\" book.  By that I mean that people who are unabashedly Republican,  Religious Right, etc., will not find unscrutinized support for their revisionist accounts of history.  While Johnson does overlap with certain conservative appraisals of historical events and figures, he does so on a case-by-case basis, always aiming to support his evaluations with fact.  In many instances, these facts are not widely known because they have been cut out from liberal textbooks.  They are not, however, smelling of the party line.\n\nIndeed, Johnson's book is fascinating for his historical scholarship, research, and deep analysis.  His coverage of \"forgotten\" spans of time (i.e. Grant, Arthur, Hayes, Garfield) is welcome, as is his deft treatment of figures who are normally expansive in coverage (i.e. Lincoln, JFK).  I found the 1860-1900 chapters to be personally most enlightening.\n\nJohnson is especially great at noticing overarching themes in government and economic life.  He is not a social or sociological commentator, which will relieve some of his more liberal readers.  And in fact, I believe most people--liberal or conservatve--would gain an awful lot from his research and presentation if they read with an open mind"

I particularly enjoyed reading his unique takes on the value of the Nixon and Coolidge presidency and his criticisms of JFK. Paul Johnson has an interesting perspective on American history, as he did not learn about as a child growing up in England.  He appproaches American history with a certain zeal not found in other historian's works. I really enjoyed reading the book after reading Zinn's work"

The author admittedly is a strong admirer of the American people and he encourages the reader to be just as supportive of the society in which we live.  He supports his view by giving the background of the various stages through which our society has grown as well as giving some insight into the personalities of those who guided our journey.  We are a rugged strong society and we did not get here by way of the route detailed in the history books that I studied going through school in the 1930's and 1940's.  Alas, maybe Washington did not cut down the cherry tree after all."

The book has everything, mystery, romance, humor, and sadness.  It's an emotionally charged book that keeps you hanging on til the end.  The main plot is around Callie an archeologist who has her life turned around after appearing on TV.  She is approached by a woman (Suzanne)who is convinced she is the daughter who was taken from her stroller in a mall when she was an infant.  After some investigating and tests, Suzanne is proved correct.  But a baby stealing/selling scheme is uncovered in the process.  Callie is determined to get to the bottom of it.  While that is going on she has to deal with her ex-husband Jake being brought in on her dig, he's an anthropologist. I don't want to get into too much detail and ruin all the surprises but there are several wonderful relationships being developed, reconciled and explored.  Callie has a new family and it is interesting to watch everyone get to know eachother and heal after this upheaval.  It is a wonderful love story and mystery.  I think this book would appeal to anyone who just loves good fiction"

The man she never gets over is there to win her heart again. Her brother who she didn't grow up with has his own love interest. A divorced couple find each other once more. Everything boils down to loyalty among friends, lovers, and family members.

This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger!

Everything from Black-market baby selling, to ancient civilizations & their cultures, to theories of ghosts & curses, to dealing with ex-romances in the workplace. Only Roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing.\n\nHere is the cliff-notes version: Witty and beautiful archaeologist Callie Dunnbrook, is sent to small town Woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site. Unfortunately, the town isn't that friendly. When people start vanishing, many wonder...could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves? Not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site; but her partner for the dig, sent from the university, is none other than her ex-husband, Jake!! To make matters worse local, famous baker, Suzanne (think-Mrs. Smith's) claims Callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant. Only problem is Callie wasn't adopted...or was she?\n\nPoor Callie must decipher clues to the past; Suzanne's, Jake's, the remains in the ground, and her own. As the old adage proves true, secrets never last forever"

      "review_text": "Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like.  It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the \"Rifle-text\", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the \"ages\" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad & twisted \"love story\" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah & Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, \"...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?\"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers & Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful & worthwhile), but here in the most \"modern\" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints & clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which \"voices\" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to & for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later.\n\nNext up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt?  From what I understand this will be about the Hopi & Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970's-1980's.  Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip & The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century.  And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians.  Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can't wait - Vollmann's dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various \"Ages\" of our North American continent."

The plight of the native people of Northern Canada (it depends on who you ask what they wish to call themselves) is not something one usually reads about.  While there have been numerous accounts of the plights of other native peoples, the arctic is usually reserved for stories about the \"great white explorers\" and have little to do with those living there.   I enjoy how Vollmann refuses to pass judgment on his characters, leaving them to become real humans.  I will continue to read this series and look forward to the next installment"

Not only is Vollman attempting to create, with some fiction, the entire history of North America, each volume he writes is a totally new undertaking. New people, names,histories, and unique grammar reflective to  the period. A truly talented author who has thoroughly researched his subjects and makes you feel that you are right in the middle of the action in the snow and ice, Vollman is writing the series out of the time seqences in which the history appears, but since each is complete in itself, that does not matter.  I look forward to his next &quot;dream.&quot"

      "review_text": "The storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes.  Americans don't have to.  Abraham Lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness, yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties, which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic.  This book is a labor of love by Mr. Carnegie about his hero; it's his way of making his hero available to us all.  I love particularly the introduction in which Mr. Carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  All the wisdom and insight Mr. Carnegie ever collected in his \"how to\" books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here, because Lincoln exemplified everything that Mr. Carnegie ever taught.  This book is what will keep Mr. Carnegie's name alive, long after his institute has folded and his \"how to\" books have gone out of print.  In this book Mr. Carnegie captures the living reality of Lincoln, his wisdom, his virtues, his beautiful and unfettered English prose, his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind, his deep reverence, and his abiding love.  This is a book that you never finish.  The experience remains with you.  Besides changing forever the way you think about Lincoln, it'll change the way you think about yourself.  This book is not overtly religious, but I'd recommend it alongside Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship, Chesterton's Everlasting Man, and Thomas Merton's Seven-Storey Mountain."

This book is terrific right from page one until the very end.  I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid.  Whatever I paid, it was worth it.  It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining.  Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends.  Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men.  \"With malice towards none and charity for all...\" these, his words, keep echoing in my mind.  Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation.  His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, \"When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion\". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to.  After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them).  This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion."

This is not the story about the Lincoln that we learned about in school. Lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest Presidents. Mr. Carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the White House. We can see the problems that Lincoln had while in the office of President. It would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if Lincoln had not been President because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable. For example, the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made Lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in Political Science or just wants to know more about the President. This is a very interesting book that I found hard to put down. I have read this many times and I cherish each moment that I spend reading the book"

I was impressed with the fact that Lincoln totally despised slavery. Especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers. His triumphs and failures make him seem much more human. Not only was he a great President, but a great human being as well. It illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain. If you can get your hands on this book, it is a must read"

While it was mildly entertaining, it contains little that is new or particularly informative.  The book generally repackages concepts that are written elsewhere and ties them to passages in Churchill's life.  Many of the comparisons seem strained.  In fact, comparing Churchill's almost single-handed stand aginst tyranny with normal business competition, seems inappropriate and a little silly.      It's probably fair to say that the book contains a few kernals of wisdom which would be helpful to anyone in business, or otherwise. These kernals are relatively simple and (it seems to me) obvious.  It begs the question, Why, exactly, do we need a book such as this?       The people most apt to pick-up the book in the first place are those who already have a more than passing affinity for Churchill.  If so, those people will likely have read books which are more informative, historically significant, insightful and generally worthwhile.  If this is your first introduction to Churchill, do not let it be your last.  Overall, I think there are much better uses for all of our valuable time"

In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill  into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been  disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that  Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend  Lincoln On Leadership"

The lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial - as if summing up Churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims.  What Mr Hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us (women included). I learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work (I too can work on my short-comings); he had many failures, some fatal for a politician, but continued to soldier on (I too can persevere); he stuck with his own sense of self-worth when every one else proclaimed him as finished (I too can maintain confidence against adversity).  The maxims, Mr Hayward, are not needed. But thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth, where we can all learn from his extraordinary life"

It seems, though, that for the 3rd Ed. he either ran out of alcohol or got an editor.

This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature"

I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \"important,\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading"

The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing.  The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control.  The humor still abounds.  The language is easier to read but no less descriptive.  No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement"

Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen.  Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change.  With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen.  He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe.  truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it"

Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story.  While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side.  I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts.  Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing.  The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable.  To me, that's a deal-breaker"

      "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. (\"Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!\") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are \"right-o, jolly-good\" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK"

It is a love story of an American girl and a very educated Chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a Chinese person, much less married one.  Her husband is a part of Sun Yet-sen's battle to topple the Manchu Dynasty.  Within the novel is the history of China from the Opium War in 1840 to the Communist's  War of Liberation in 1949.  Good insight into the people of China and their relationship with the Western Powers"

This book goes back and imposing upon historical events the decisions made by Elizabeth-I and how it would apply in business today.  There are certain parallels between a monarchy and corporation that do fit together and can be seen in examples.  The major portion of the book covers the image that Elizabeth set forth by taking on being the  image of the Mother Mary (Catholic church) to her subjects, thus, to make the people more accepting of the new Church of England as the religious seat of power, thus diffusing the Vatican's hold over the people. My only complaint, like others opinions, there were no mention of where things went wrong, only highlighting the good things.  This is a very good book still and I recommend it along with another book called Big Chief Elizabeth (which is more of the history of the new World and Elizabeth's funding of the voyages to capture more land)."

In a way, it is to be regretted that not only was she aware of her impending death, but that she decided to do her own English version. Fallaci's English was not up to the task and, as a result, the book is an unnecessarily difficult read which will understandably put many people off.\n\nToo bad because Fallaci's message is important. Fallaci correcetly perceives the menace of Islam in Europe. She recognizes the mass migration of Muslims and their refusal to assimilate as an invasion intended to conquer Europe. She laments, loudly and shrilly, the craven cowardice of the politically correct left. What really infuriated Europe's so-called liberals was Fallaci's tracing of their history back through their origins as socialists, fascists and communists. Fallaci distinguishes between the \"left\" of pre-Bolshevik days and the \"left\" that emerged after WWII and predominates in Europe today.\n\nFallaci engages in a lot of self-referential comments, talking about her \"martyrdom\". She was badly treated by the intellectuals in Europe who did not like her message. Her self-pity is understandable, but a distraction.\n\nFallaci's message is simple in the end: \"The decline of intelligence is he decline of Reason . . . Refusing to admit that all Islam is a pond inside which we are drowning, in fact, is against Reason.A\"\n\nFallaci provides more than ample evidence of her latter point which proves the former. Many will not appreciate Fallaci's message, but no one will be able to disprove her facts.\n\nJerr"

Second, she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts.  For instance, she quietly forgot the role of Christianity in the Conquest of the Americas and the slaughter of the Indian races.  Or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the European powers.  And what about the survival of Catholicism in Spain in spite of eight centuries  of Muslim domination?  Yes, there were churches and  synagogues in Muslim Spain.  This manifesto doesn't look very different from those fascists wrote about Jews in Europe in the 1930s.   Poor woman."

Her fellow Europeans essentially expelled her from the continent.  They made Fallaci's final years a living hell.  As an ex-Catholic, I am more then a little irritated by the Roman Church's capitulation to the radical Muslims.  Fallaci described herself as a Christian atheist and was more of a defender of the \"true faith\" than its own hierarchy!  \"This Catholic Church without which the Islamization of Europe, the degeneration of Europe into Eurabia, could have never have developed. This Catholic Church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted,\" added the author.\n\nFallaci rebukes the politically correct and cowardly European culture which is unwilling to combat Islam's racist, sexist, and homophobic doctrines.  Fallaci quotes Denis Diderot's accurate description of Islam as \"the enemy of reason.\"  The anti-intellectualism and contempt for secular learning pervading the religion of Mohammed cannot be disputed.  What has the Muslim world accomplished in the last 400-500 years?  Will its more militant adherents return us to the misery of the 8th Century?   Are there any life affirming moderate Muslims?  If so, where are they?  Oriana Fallaci deserves a statue erected in her honor.  Will her memory encourage us during our inevitable future trials and tribulations?  I strongly believe that this will indeed be the case.\n\nDavid Thomson\nFlares into Darknes"

She shares some of these ideas with her readers by alluding herself to writer from centuries ago named Master Cecco who, in pursuit of standing up for his beliefs, was thought to be a witch who was later burned at the stake and then the reader is treated to a wealth of information concerning the Troy burnings. Fallaci wastes no time is sharing her views against Islamic terrorists and looks with contempt upon any civilization or religion that does not do everything within the scope of its power to stand up to them"

Her last years were spent in the United States in part because she was hunted in her own beloved Italy because of her war against the Islamic jihad. A fatwa calling for death was issued an Islamic jihadist; an Italian judge attempted to put her in jail for offending the invaders. She found refuge in the United States. But she also embraced America as her homeland in exile because she understood that America was the global center of resistance to the Islamic threat. The attacks of 9/11 inspired her. From her sick bed she wrote two polemics -- The Rage and The Pride and The Force of Reason which are clarion calls to action to defend the West. If we prevail in this battle to defend our civilization they will be remembered in the same way that Tom Paine's Common Sense is remembered as a summons to Americans to defend their freedom. Orianna Fallaci was a woman of unbelievable courage. We will not see her like again soon. May we honor her by heeding her warnings and dedicating ourselves to the struggle to which she gave her final hours.\""

For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU."

      "review_text": "There are thousands of self-help books in the management section of your local bookstore, covering a bewildering spectrum of ideas about how to bring out the best in people. Few of them are helpful, beyond trite statements about human behavior, and even fewer of them are based on more than a modicum of research. Now, Discover Your Strengths is an excellent book on both counts. The Gallup organization has studied excellence in many fields for over thirty years. This book summarizes some of that research from the perspective of identifying and bolstering people's talents.\n\nThe writers worked hard to make the book clear, precise, and readable. The book never sacrifices clarity, even when faced with complex ideas. I had to read the book twice to make sure that the straightforward writing wasn't masking conceptual problems. It wasn't. The writers lay out the main idea right away; they write that \"to excel in your chosen field and to find lasting satisfaction in doing so, you will need to...become an expert at finding and describing and applying and practicing and refining your strengths.\" They go on to describe precisely what they mean by \"strengths,\" then they give you a tool to discover your own strengths by taking an on-line test.\n\nThe outstanding thing about Now, Discover Your Strengths is the foundation of research that supports it. The Gallup folks are serious about their research. The claims in this book are based on reliable studies of almost 2 million employees. If you have any doubts about their research methods, the writers supply a technical report on the StrengthsFinder tool in an appendix. I almost wet my pants with glee, reading about interrater reliability, modern test theory, and \"big five\" personality factors. All of this is safely ignored in favor of the practical suggestion in the main sections of the book, but it makes a skeptic like me confident in recommending this book to everyone on my team.\n\nHere are the main reasons why I recommend this book with no reservations:\n\n1) It's based on exhaustive research\n\n2) It comes with a free test...a similar tool  would cost hundreds of dollars if you bought it from a career counselor or management consultant.\n\n3) It is carefully written and eminently practical.\n\nNow, go buy yourself a copy, take the test, and start a strengths revolution at your own workplace"

      "review_text": "Just when I figured I had seen it all, \"Now Discover Your Strengths\" comes along with a new outlook and a dynamic paradigm. A unique difference from others in its genre is the \"Strengths Finder Profile\" (can be interfaced on the internet).  It covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits.  Chapter 4, page 83, does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four \"themes\" of leadership.\n\nIf I may paraphrase Vince Lombardi (the legendary football coach): \"In practice I do not worry about what other teams are doing. If we concentrate on what we do best, the game will take care of itself.\" I found that philosophy to be the essence of this book.  Focus on your strengths instead of trying to change weaknesses.\n\nIt is amazing how many companies make this mistake with their employees.  When trying to improve sales, and reduce turnover, they focus on the weakest link (the bottom) when more productivity can be realized by rewarding, emulating, and promoting the best producers.\n\nThose who have been obsessed with what is wrong in their lives will discover a better way is to learn what works best for themselves and others. The authors' ideas are motivational, inspirational and can be implemented by anyone.\n\nThere are some revealing comparisons in the book to another prototype leader (Warren Buffett). Readers will be surprised and infinitely impressed with the key reasons for his success.\n\nThis book should be a must read for anyone in a leadership position looking to improve the bottom line. It is very well done and has no comparison.  Reading it gave me strength, buy it and discover yours!\n\nReginald V. Johnson, author, \"How To Be Happy, Successful And Rich\""

How else can you perform at your peak unless you are doing something you absolutely love.  When you know your strenghts, it's easier to focus on being successful where you are.

This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.\n\nAs for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.\n\nYour money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10"

      "review_text": "Being aware myself that men talk about their seed when it would be more accurate to talk about their pollen I was intrigued to come across such an extensive theory based on this very mistaken metaphor.\nThis book is a great read and certainly we need to understand human nature and include it in our understanding of our history and ourselves today. McElvaine makes a good first stab at this and I will not repeat his argument again but point out a few important errors.\n\nThe faults with the book concern the biology, both the factual errors and the lack of real exploration. The descriptions of the mating behavior of primates are not fully correct, especially regarding gorillas - the silverback has a very small penis and testicles and little interest in sex except when a female is ovulating which means at intervals of three to four years, hardly comparable to humans. McElvaine also says that animals rarely kill members of their own species but Dian Fossey stated that 25% of gorilla mortality was due to the male gorilla - he kills both other males and infants if he ousts a resident male.\n\nThe biggest error is that apes are, in fact, not matrilineal. In chimpanzees and bonobos the males remain for life in their natal group and the females leave at puberty. This is most likely the case for hominids and humans ie human females have hardly ever been matilineal and had the benefit of this base for kin or female-female bonding.\n\nMcElvaine makes a big case for human 'mounting' behavior which may be valid but amongst other primate species there is no universal evidence for it correlating directly with dominance and submission. Sometimes the dominant individual is mounted, sometimes females mount their female 'friends', sometimes a presentation is a way to give an olfactory signal by a dominant. Also, presentations that are submissive are very different from the upright, assertive, four-square stance of a female soliciting a copulation.\n\nThese errors do not greatly undermine any of the arguments but do show that when we are going to use biology in an argument we need to know more than just a little biology. The fact that human males have nearly always spent their whole life with kin when females have had to join a new group to breed is an enormously important factor in the repression of human females and the dominance of men and masculine values - including men fighting over possession of such females. Looking at primate behavior tends to show that the roots of some of our behavior were very deep and strong well before agriculture came along.\n\nAlso, even if we do think more about the male/female spectrum of human nature there may well be a number of males at the masculine end of the spectrum who are not striving to be anything other than they naturally are - ie are extreme males who simply have little or no capacity for feminine values. If these are the dangerous males then the best we can do is to stop allowing them and their virtual 100% masculinity to be the role models for the more average male - or even the average human.\n\nMcElvaine's points about the false metaphors we use,  male-biased language and attitudes, misogyny, a male creator, the belittling of feminine values and behaviors and the impossible way men try to be 'notawoman' are certainly strong and in many ways obvious when pointed out. And it is surely foolish to think that such a lop-sided species can hope for anything other than toppling over in the mightiest of Falls.\n\nMcElvaine offers a few ideas about how we might be able to overcome our maladaptive proclivities but it is an enormous task both to recognize our human errors and for men to ever overcome their maladaptive inheritance and genuinely not feel so much contempt for the feminine in human nature. It is hard to imagine the necessary changes coming any time soon.\n\nA highly recommended read and hopefully it will open up essential further explorations in this area"

It passed some time since that but the concepts I read are still fresh in my memory, since it were concepts I've been suspicious for a long time. One might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male \"impotence\", but if you take an impartial look you'll find he is right. Don't get me wrong: I have no problems in beeing a man, but I'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure, on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman, that he is not a sissy or a gay - wich is even worse -, but, on the contrary, that he is a real macho, a sex machine that can \"score\" as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence. It's sad but it's the reality.\nFortunately, things are changing. In Spain we had notice of the first girl (she's 16) that joined a senior male soccer team as an advancee. In Germany, Angela Merkel is the first woman to be nominated chancelor. In the great majority of western countries, the armed forces do accept equally male and female recruits.\nIt reminds me the movie of 007 \"Goldeneye\", when the Admiral said to M (a woman) that she didn't had the \"balls\" to stand in face of the situation, to wich she replied that she had the advantage of not having to be thinking with them all the time...\nIt would be nice if in the future our leaders will think less with the \"balls\" and more with the brains.."

I guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self-loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership.

A real pleasure and a book that is priceless if you like the history of American cuisine"

As I was born and raised outside the U.S., the tidbits about American culinary history in the book are very fascinating.  I had to try exotics like soup mongole (a Campbell combination soup), and I admit it is pretty good.  The ethnic recipes that entered American mainstream are often Americanized, but it should not be surprising because it is the American Century Cookbook after all"

Because I did not want to give half my  salary to fast food restaurants and eat from stryofoam for the rest of my  life, I decided I ought learned how to cook.  That is when I started  collecting cookbooks. I started with Cooking For Dummies and went on from  there.  I quickly found that I had a knack for cooking and soon came to  enjoy it.  As my cookbook collection grew, I quickly discovered that there  were two types of cookbooks:  Those you cook from and those you read.  This  is the first cookbook that I have found is good for both.  The recipes  included are fabulous and it is a great book to browse.  The recipes come  on all levels so the cooking klutzes and the Julia Childs alike will be  able to use it.  When you buy this book, and you certainly SHOULD buy this  book, go directly to the recipe for blondies.  I had never heard of them  before but they are cheap and easily made.  After I made the first batch, I  made a double batch to take to work where I had just started.  Let's just  say it made breaking the ice in a large office a lot easier.  Thanks, Ms.  Anderson"

Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.\n\nThis book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing.  I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it.  But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did.  I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat."

It's a no-nonsense, no frills, \"I am what I am\" voice that doesn't try to entice you into the story with a lot of flowery language. In Judge & Jury, the story is written from a first-person perspective: that of FBI Senior Agent Nick Pellisante.  For years, Nick has been on the trail of a powerful Mafia don, named Dominic Cavello, and his efforts are about to pay off.  Nick trails Cavello to the wedding of his favorite niece and successfully captures him.\n\nThe story picks up the pace after Andie is introduced as one of the jurors selected for the court case against Cavello. Andie is a single mom and an out-of-work actress who is trying to make ends meet with low-paying acting jobs that her agent can get for her.  The suspense heats up when Cavello's people hires a world-renown assassin to help him get out of jail.  The assassin is successful and what follows is a devastating tragedy that forever changes the lives of those involved. Cavello's ruthlessness, however, puts him squarely in the path of an enraged mother who will stop at nothing to get her revenge.\n\nJudge & Jury is an easy read but also very entertaining. You'll not be disappointed."

Although everyone reports favorably on the book, it does make for some pretty droopy-eyed siteseeing the next day.  I loved the premise of this one - felt I knew the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip to Ushuaia.  I never knew what the end of the world was like, but now I feel I've been there.  As a writer myself, I marvel at James Patterson's output. I guess if he experiences writer's block, he just says, \"Here, Andrew, you write for a while.\"  Whatever the procedure, they hit an ace with this one.  And, what's really great is that while I'm still riding the crest of the wave on Judge and Jury, the news reports another new book about to be launched - \"Cross\".  I can't wait!"

Smog deals again with the futility of human life through pollution.  The Argentine Ants is a type of mock horror story.  All of the above are extremely well written and executed.

The events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young Luke Chandler.\nThe author creates much the same feel that you get from Rawling's The Yearling, though this is not really a coming-of-age story. As you sit on the porch listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, you become one of the family in this book. You hear the local gossip, worry about the uncle in Korea, and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop.\nThe relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant Mexican workers, the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks.\nI'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify, but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of Luke."

It honestly was not like anything else of his that I've read, and I was happily surprised.\n\nThe story of a farming family and the workers they take on that summer to help with picking cotton, is one that sweeps you up almost immediately.  The characters are so rich in description and the dialogue so compelling that before you know it you're thrown into the middle of the story that centers around a young boy who is trying his best to interpret the world around him.  In the meantime he's growing up a bit too fast.\n\nThe conclusion tied the perfect bow on this present of a story.  I'd definitely recommend this book to someone, especially Grisham fans who may have a bit of trepidation in reading something not centered around law."

      "review_text": "John Steinbeck is one of my favorite all-time authors (The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden).  Grisham has managed to capture Steinbeck's style and weave a tale that captures the reader right from the first paragraph!\n\nLuke is a 7 year old farm boy who dreams of leaving the farm and playing baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals.  His family are cotton farmers and every summer they hire a group of \"hill\" people and Mexican migrants to help them pick the year's cotton crop.  The work is grueling (long hours in the hot sun) and Luke must pitch in.  The only respite Luke gets is a trip to town on Saturday afternoons where he can get a coke and see a movie (usually a Gene Autry western or something along that genre).\n\nWhat happens is that the group hired has a scary dangerous man (Hank) who loves to beat up and maim people, a young girl named Talley who likes to charm young Luke and a simple minded boy (I forgot his name) who decides that he will paint Luke's house (it has never been painted in 50 years and thus the title of the book comes from this).\n\nLuke is exposed to a good deal of secrets (two murders and the knowledge that his brother who is away fighting in Korea may have gotton a neighboring 15 year old pregnant).\n\nThe writing is superb and it excellently captures a forgotten time (life on a farm in the early 50's).  I liked this book better than Grisham's courtroom dramas and I hope he has some more of these type of novels up his sleeve"

I don't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading A Painted House by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found.  And right he was.  This story was touching and fast-paced.  It was enjoyable along the same lines as To Kill a Mockingbird (the only courtroom story I've ever enjoyed) in its background and overall feel.  I didn't like the ending - not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't flow with the rest of the book (a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together) but because it's not the way I wished it would go.  All-in-all a great book and highly recommendable"

Sp may parallels (not the least of which is the painting).  Not since The Client (another Grisham favorite) has there been such an engaging juvenile protagonist.  Like some reviews, I found it hard to imagine that Luke was a seven-year-old.  I think any other child that age would have a few more sleepless nights witnessing some of the events in the novel and keeping them secret as long as he does.  But the atmosphere painted by Grisham draws the reader right into the backwater Arkansas area in the hot, humid fields.  Humorous, touching, and above all riveting"

It has been 4 or 5 years since I have read it and the characters and unforgettable scenes still linger in my head.\n\nGrisham steps out of the box and encircles a world of writing that I would like to see more of from him. This story is supposed to be loosely based on his own upbringing and the passion and honesty of his experiences are transposed into an adventurous tale.\n\nI agree with the other reviewer that the boy shouldn't have been 7 years old and more like 10 or 11. (I have 4 boys myself). I think this is the only weak spot in the story. It just isn't convincing enough to me that he is that young, especially in 1952 when a 7 year old was truly a 7 year old"

That kind of cynicism and satirical writing can be horrible if not handled well, but he pulls it off and I've enjoyed the several titles I've had a chance to read.\n\nThis one was funny and pointed out some of the absurd things we let happen in our houses of government.  While the story centers around a stripper, it is really a story about corruption and politics.\n\nIn any case, if you haven't had a chance to check out this author, this is a good a place as any I suppose and I give this one a strong recommendation"

      "review_text": "The mystery of why every single Carl Hiaasen book hasn't been made into a movie has finally been solved.  Suffice it to say that Mr. Hiaasen should be allowed to slap Demi Moore until her head falls off, and his readers should have the right to go Skink on anyone else who took part in the debacle that was \"Strip Tease\" the movie.\n\nUnbeknownst to stripper Erin Grant, she is at the center of a big cover-up the night one drunk beats up another with a champagne bottle while she's onstage.  The bottle wielder is none other than US Congressman David Dilbeck, who heads the committee that keeps sugar prices artificially high and ensuring fat profits for corporate sugar farmers, who in turn pay their workers disgustingly low wages.   Dilbeck is recognized by one customer who is so infatuated with Erin he offers to blackmail the congressman into helping her get custody of her daughter, which she lost in the divorce because of the job she had to take in order to pay her attorney fees.  When the customer disappears, his body later found by Florida detective Al Garcia while on vacation in Montana, Garcia links the death to a missing attorney and his cousin, who happened to be the fianc\u001ae of the man who was bludgeoned by Dilbeck with the champagne bottle.  At the same time, the bouncer at Erin's strip club, the Eager Beaver, had been attempting to earn a huge settlement by planting a roach in a carton of yogurt.  His attorney happened to be the same one who went missing.  Erin's ex also goes off the deep end, his drug habit and wheelchair stealing getting out of control as he gets closer and closer to losing it.  There's quite a cast of characters, between the bigshots behind the scenes keeping Dilbeck's career on track to the cast of dancers and crooked managers of both the Eager Beaver and its rival club, the Flesh Farm.  It's great entertainment all the way, which just makes me wonder how the unskilled moron who hacked this book into a screenplay managed to miss it all and come up with the script that made it to the big screen.\n\nMaybe I was a little prejudiced because of that awful excuse for a movie, but it took me a few chapters to really get into this book.  Erin was a bit much of a powerless victim at the beginning, but once she gets mad enough to start taking some drastic action, things get going and this wound up being one of my favorite Hiaasen novels.  It's got everything we expect from him:  a convoluted plot full of off-the-wall characters and plenty of laughs.  It even managed to overcome the stigma of sharing a title with the worst movie I have ever seen."

In this book he tackles some of the issues that he has been known to expose in the past.\n\nIn this book his protagonist is a young woman, Erin, who loses her job at the FBI because of her husbands felonious past. She then loses her daughter when her husbands past is hidden by the very people sworn to protect her when he is 'hired' as a confidential informant.\n\nErin ends up turning to exotic dancing as it is the only way for her to make the money she needs to fight for her daughters' custody. I found this commentary on society, in particular our views on women's jobs and pay, to very poignant. The only way Erin can make thousands of dollars  is to expose herself to the very men who are judging her to be an unfit mother.\n\nFollowing the theme of previous Hiaasen novels, the antagonists are corrupt and oblivious to the harm they cause to both the environment and their constituents. The descriptions of the misconduct is both intriguing and scary.\n\nHiaasen continues to impress with his sarcastic and witty style. If dark humor is what you fancy, you won't be dissapointed in this outing from one of the best writers in the genre"

      "review_text": "To paraphrase from preface's the famous Dr. Noam Chomsky's (a personal hero) suggestion regarding our ignorance, we do not have any idea  how this vast mystery called the mind could be solved.  I have read this book the year it first came out (1997) and many times over since; should one still belive that thoughts, feelings, beliefs, meanings or ideas that all generated from this wonderful gold mine we called the mind can ever be understood?  Dr. Pinker served as a wonderful tour guide to simply and elegantly point out some sailent features and functions of the mind that we ,I mean any non-psychologist, take for granted every day.  I use my mind every day.  (My wife and co-workers might want to argue otherwise, but they are wrong!  I do think on a daily basis.).  Yet I don't have any clue on the inner workings inside my own brain.  Is the 17 th century French philiospher Rene Descart right when he proclaimed \"I think therefore I am?\"  What insight and understanding have we gain regarding our mind since Descart's time?  Another words, do we have any better understanding how thoughts and ideas are generated and processed in our mind?  Dr. Pinker, now at Harvard and a gaint in this field, do not have the answers.  As a matter of fact, he was not even sure all or any of our current understanding and guesses would later proven to be true.  However, he has painted an overall picture on the state-of-art research on cognition.  Oh, the book.  It has eight chapters with interesting and enticing titles and he tried (I think and hope) to tickle readers' imaginations and challange our mostly unproven assumptions and beliefs.  For example, under the standard equipment chapter, rationality and decision making serve as a frame work to discuss the complexity of our mind.  He used the working definition of intlliegence (ie the ability to attain goals by assessing obstracles along the way and modify one's action to reach that point) to illustrate that we use our desires (ie the latest big screen Sony TV) and use our beliefs (ie if I work extra 50 hours per week to generate more income) to increase the chance of achieving that result (i.e. watching the Final Four basketball games on SONY big screen TV).   Yet is this stimluli (vivid and beautiful live college hoops on TV) and response (working extra hours to generate estimated 5000 dollars of income) due to thinking or is this just a result fo a physical response from a sensory input?  Do we endlessly shop for junks we cannot possibly need because of a physcial response of a sensory stimuli and not due to brain activities at all?  Perhaps endless charges on credit cards of the mall rats have nothing to do with the minds or intelligence but a mere knee-jerk response to stimuli.  What about the molecular/celluar level of the brain?  Can we understand how the mind work if we exam and understand how each cell in our brain work and therefore how the mind work?  From page 99, Dr. Pinker stated from the mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts that neurons have one purpose in life: \"add up a set of qualites and compare the sum to a threshold and indicate whether the threshod is exceeded.\"  Are you joking me?  With a description like this, it sounded more like a description of a computer than a living breathing cell let alone a functional neuron.  Suppose we have a complete and perfect understanding of a neuron on a celluar and molecular level, as he pointed out in the next few pages it is the interconnectiveness (my own invention to summarize the vastly complicated neural networks) that might be more important than any single cell.  Another words, perhaps thoghts, ideas, imagination, emotions and other abstraction generated from our mind might be the results of these \"supercomputer\" networking.  This conjucture might be completely wrong but interesting nevertheless.  What about complexity itself?  Can the fact that we are the product of millions of years of natural selections and therefore the compelexity of any organ in our body including the brain is resulted from million years of fuctional and adapive survival?  It is beyond imagination of my limited mind (no pun intended) that perhaps I don't have adequate brain power to understand my mind?  So why should I or any one care how my mind think and why my mind think a certain way?  A mental life is the result of my mind, and it is utterly unexplainable in most cases.  Why certain stimuli upset me to the nth degree and only at certain time and space?  Is my mind too limited or incapable of overcoming those undesireable yet almost unaviodable negative feelings?  Why can I be peaceful and happy like I want to be every time I am sitting in traffic idle for hours on that big parking lot we called the 210 freeway in Los Angeles?  Dr. Pinker has no answers for my agony or a way to relief my mental anguish.  He only gave me a clue as to the possible explainations and ideas.  I keep this book close to me at an arm's reach every time my mind fails me (more frequent than I like now days and I am only 36 years old) and I re-read it over and over for its shear beauty, audacity, and clarity.  Unquestion the authorative guide to my or any one's mind"

      "review_text": "Have you been amazed by the things your body can do(and probably cannot do) ... like the great stereo vision, the spatial hearing capability, the ease at which we learn/speak/update multiple languages. How does our brain achieve all this? How does our brain stores and incorporates new information? Where do human emotions come from? What is the reason behind anger, fear and other multitudes of human emotions? What is this thing called consciousness? What is the reason behind the peculiar male, female behaviour? What makes our ties to blood relations so strong? Why we find enjoyment in Art? What is life ... Why do we exist?\n\nI personally have been intrigued by these and more of these questions. Most of the time we relegate answers to these questions to some divine entity and many of them we just take for granted. However, this is one of the books that attempts to answer or shares insights to answers to some of these questions. In short this book is going to blow your mind away(literally & figuratively). This book not only tries to enlighten us but also makes us ask more questions about our own existence. In general author contends that the evolution process contributed towards the development of different faculties. In affect we own most of our cool faculties to survival instinct of our genes. The author(a great scientist) provides some interesting evidences to support his thinking.\n\nOne thing I liked about this book is that it is written in a very simple and easy to comprehend language. It avoids references to tongue twisting weird words like Myelography, Parietal, Occipital. Another thing I liked about this book is that it conveys lots of nice information/know-how via the means of references to interesting anecdotes from Calvin and Hobbes, Godfather and like.\n\nAll in all this is a must, must read ... it is going to leave your awe-struck!\n\n-Sachi"

      "review_text": "As a layman (even athough I was trained as an engineer), I was quite ambivalent when faced with the ultimate purchase decision for this book, especially after I have read most of the editorial & readers' reviews on the net. I was really intrigued by the fact that many readers took heavy pot shots at both the author & his book. My decision was further compounded by the fact that the book was thick - over 600 pages - & the apparent level of complexity, judging from my random five-finger test.\n\nHowever my deep personal interest in understanding brain science & the curiosity streak in me finally drove me to buy the book.\n\nThe first half was quite an easy ride for me as the author offered a general model to explain how & why the mind works the way it does. This is despite the fact that the writing was dry & monotonous in most areas, witty & crisp in some areas & cram packed with seemingly irrelevant information. The second half was a tough ride for me as the author touched on the implications of social behaviours.\n\nFrankly, I am not disappointed by the book even though I am still puzzled by some parts of the book. My own personal assessment of the book is that it is an intellectual smorgasbord of disparate, multi-disciplinary scientific topics/facts (e.g. natural selection, artificial intelligence, neural networks, economics, biology, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, family values, feminism, emotions, etc.) which probably make my reading somewhat difficult, especially towards the second half of the book.\n\nAt the end, I have really enjoyed reading this book, particularly in terms of what I am looking for in the first place. I also like the author's extensive notes and large reading lists.\n\nThe most productive learning experience for me is a better understanding (may be I should say another perspective) of visual perception. In fact, in Chapter 4, the author has dedicated an almost entire chapter (from page 214 to 242) to the perception of random-dot sterograms (or 3D visual illusions).  As far as I know, this is the only brain book (after discounting Bela Julesz's book) that I have come across that touches on this wonderful topic, which also happens to be one of my pet subjects.\n\nOn the whole, & from my personal perspective, this somewhat wonderful book definitely gives a reasonably good coverage on the intricacies & idiosyncracies of the human mind, in spite of what the author had admitted in the preface: \"First, we don't understand how the mind works...\""

The writing is crisp, witty, lucid, and provocative.  I contented myself with how he substantiated his research, albeit there is a sense of having completely arrived with a comprhensive overview of the human mind and subsequent behavior.  I'm sure there is more to be discovered and scrutinized, but the genie is out of the bottle now, and one is compelled to relentlessly and tenaciously pursue this endeavor after reading this book.  Pinker will bring you under this compulsion, if not absolutely convincingly but if only to fan the flames of inquiry.  Dare to read, dare to change, dare to think.  For some, Pinker will open up a 'Pandora's box', but he will leave you with a cautious optimism as well.  This read will stike you like Dorothy stepping into color for the first time.  This book is now permanently shelved for future reference, which is very telling, because I simply can't say that about the vast majority of material I've read to this date"

      "review_text": "I first read this book shortly after it was published and it was one that started me on a journey of discovery about natural selection and sexual selection. From being someone who was more focussed on social sciences at last I had discovered a more scientific way of understanding the world that made much more sense. The natural world, human societies and my own family relationships began to connect in a more comprehensible whole.\n\nSo the best parts of the book for me are those about natural selection and Family Values rather than the workings of the human mind, though these sections are also a very good read.\n\nHaving read widely since, I know there is far more that needs to be understood. Particularly with sexual selection there are a lot of women, like myself, who are aware that female sexuality throughout the animal kingdom is more complex than has been thought with female promiscuity far more prevalent than would be expected with the assumption that a female only needs to mate with one male.\n\nAlso, with human females having concealed ovulation a man could mate with vast numbers of females and never have a single offspring whereas it is the female who needs to be mating a lot when she is ovulating - and not necessarily with only one male.\n\nIt is only humans that have females producing all their offspring from a single father - in other species, though a male may have exclusive access to a number of females it is never for life and he will be replaced or the female will move to another male.\n\nPinker does make clear points about human males owning daughters, sisters and wives and enforcing monogamy on them, which naturally overrides female mate choice. He is not offensive in the way some male writers are when they write as if females are naturally passive and monogamous while males gleefully exploit one female after another.\n\nIn this book Pinker writes better about the sexes than he does in 'The Blank Slate' when he writes about rape.\n\nThough I now know enough to be able to question points in this book, I still think it is an excellent read and would recommend it to anyone and everyone."

      "review_text": "1. Discuss the main ideas that you found most important in this book and discuss why they were important to you.\n\n`As A Man Thinketh' by James Allen encompasses the idea that \"All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.\" James Allen eloquently explains how our thoughts create our reality and that \"In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man's weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own and not another man's.\" Before reading the book I was unsure to what extent our thoughts played in the creation of our experience. I have always believed we can do whatever we put our minds to, though I was unsure of what extent we could exercise control in the creation of our experience and by what means does one actively create? After reading this book I felt my questions were answered and life suddenly took on a whole new perspective. I felt as though I had uncovered another piece of the jigsaw puzzle of life, slotting into place a new perspective that not only helped uncover and concretize a new understanding of life but also shone light across the rest of the picture. A world of possibilities became apparent with the realization that through an effort in right thinking and observation of circumstance I could begin to experiment to see just what exactly I can create. This same observation would bring clarity to how my negative thinking affects reality and what role it has in my learning and progress.\n\nCircumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.\n\nAs each day passes the message this book puts forward becomes ever increasingly apparent. \"Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.\" Mentally reviewing past experiences I can see and understand the correlation between thoughts I had chosen to entertain and my circumstances. Looking at my present situation I can see how my thoughts are synchronous with the reality I see before me. At an ever increasing pace I am now seeing how quickly my thoughts change and effect my present, my future and my past. The more I practice looking at life as a reflection and part of myself the more it seems like a game where we have to remain aware and look for clues as to how to best attune ourselves to the thoughts that will allow us to interact with our situation in the most harmonious way.\n\nUntil thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to \"drift\" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.\n\nReading this book helped me to understand that there is no such thing as chance and that we can all take responsibility for every occurrence in our lives. Through the acceptance of responsibility we can use our current experience to design a way forward which best serves everybody. If there is nobody else to blame except ourselves then we should be thankful to all those involved in revealing what we ourselves have created.\n\n2. Can you relate the ideas or concepts in this book to your personal circumstances in life such as your relationships, your beliefs, your goals, your values, etc? Explain.\n\nSince reading As A Man Thinketh one of my goals now is to help as many of the people around me, as I can, to think about and use the ideas put forth in the book to construct their own viewpoint from which they can then draw conclusions. Embracing the gift of responsibility for a power which grants us control over our circumstances would change the fundamentals of society. I believe this would push us all in a more positive direction. I can vividly imagine a world where people were encouraged to think outside the construct of the societal framework, frames which less binds us together as it does section us off from the world outside of the box. If our circumstances our brought about by our thinking then it would equate that global circumstances are a reflection of our collective global thinking. If we were to fundamentally change the way we think about reality, and even learn to positively influence reality, then the world will outwardly reflect this change in thinking. My goal in life is to attune my thoughts to ones that will help turn the vision I see of a world that works for everybody into a reality.\n\nReading `As a Man Thinketh' helped move me to one of the most exciting standpoints yet, which is that there is no such thing as chance. Looking from one angle it would not appear to me that everything is predestined. I do, however, think we co-create every situation in our lives through our thinking. Our thoughts assist in the creation of our reality and when we don't pay attention to our thoughts and feelings then the situations our subconscious mind creates might seem random and we may use the `chance' concept as a valid excuse and reason for not taking responsibility for the unwanted experience. Realizing I have no excuses for anything has been a huge turning point in my life. The idea to me makes life in my mind fair. At least for the experiences I can vouch for.\n\nWhen I read the book much of what was said was immediately apparent and I had already come to a similar conclusion about some of my past experiences. About three years ago, just before I left England, I fell out with my best friend Huw who I had been friends with for ten years. One weekend in the summer of '02 after I had just come back from a holiday with Huw and some of our other friends. In the evening a group of us came together to meet and some rather unexpected events took place. The crux of the story is that Huw decided to take somebody else's word over mine with regards to a then recent situation. The information Huw had chosen to believe suddenly left our friendship of ten years in a less than an existent state of being. At first the situation seemed like a chance happening and I was perplexed by how such a situation could have come about, having arisen from decisions based on what I knew to be a fabrication. I felt powerless suddenly and life seemed arbitrary. I really didn't understand how such a situation could have come about. Could it be that sometimes life was unfair? For days I was caught up in a circular mess of thoughts, searching for the cause of the situation. I started with thinking that the person who had lied to Huw was to blame and that Huw had had issues anyway. I came to various conclusions, however they all included the idea that sometimes things happen that we have no control over. This stirred more confusion in me as it was something I did not wish to believe. After really stepping out of the picture, leaving the country for Cambodia, which for me really put a new and helpful perspective on life, and then thinking about my relationship with Huw retrospectively I came to see that just as 'Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself.' life was revealing to me what unfortunate circumstances could come about as the result of a build up and accumulation of unaddressed problems throughout our relationship. I asked myself how a friend of ten years would believe this person over me and with this in mind the actual truth of the situation is in my opinion irrelevant. If I had been a good enough friend to Huw then trust would have gone without question. I had lost the trust and faith of a friend. The deterioration of my relationship with Huw had gotten out of control and manifested a situation where I was forced to pay attention. The situation had happened in such a way that it forced me to pay attention to what was important. It wasn't anything to do with one situation. I had created my own fate way before that from all the things over the years which had built up and built up and probably already given me countless clues I should have paid attention to, until finally it was right in my face and I had to pay attention.\n\nA man does not come to the alms-house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force. The criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself and the shaper of and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes of its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and impurity, its strength and weakness.\n\n3. What are the most important new ideas or concepts you learned from this book? Please Explain.\n\nOne of the most important new ideas this book helped me grasp was the idea that there is no such thing as chance and that we are solely responsible for our personal circumstances.\n\nAfter reading As a Man Thinketh it felt strongly apparent that this world of ours works in just the way it's supposed to, indeed quite perfectly, and it would seem to me that it is us who are playing the game of life some how unaware of the rules. James Allen has given a wonderful example and explanation of how life works in perfectly fair way.\n\nIf there is no chance and our situation is brought about by our thoughts then how does that relate to a situation in life such as being diagnosed with cancer? My understanding follows that smoking does not directly cause cancer, it creates the ideal environment where a cancer could grow. It is my feeling that our thoughts and actions are intrinsically related and our mind, body and spirit are intrinsically connected and reflect one another. I believe we all have what I can at best describe as a magical force inside us. Ever seen starwars? I feel the outcome of our life depends on whether we control the force, or whether it controls us. Where does cancer come from? I think we create it. I think through our thoughts and actions and choice of lifestyle and things we choose to expose ourselves to... and through our neglect of certain areas of our life, that we cause such a thing as cancer, and indeed everything else, to manifest.\n\nWe all have the power to create some really powerful things whether it is consciously and for the greater good, or unconsciously and perhaps for the worse. I think this also works on a global level reflecting our world wide collective consciousness. I think every single one of us is responsible for the state of the world - all the conflicts of the world, or the cancers of the world, so to speak. Take for example the conflict in Iraq or the Israeli situation, the problems in South Asia... I believe it's all a reflection of our collective state of mind and the conflicts that go on inside of us. We are in control... you, me... everybody. And we all have blood on our hands.\n\nPaul Sartre once said that all human anguish comes from our individual responsibility for what each of us do and become. There is no fixed human nature, no predestination, no God that determines our course. And we suffer because we cannot handle this burden.\n\nThe power to think, feel, express, believe, will, do and progress is, from the start, all within our hands. This is an extremely dangerous distribution of power, and on some level we all know it. As a result, most of us sacrifice our liberties to tradition and majority in an effort to off-load that responsibility.\n\nAnd we do it because we have a lot invested in our communal uniformity. Life in orthodoxy is comfortable, familiar and requires nothing of us to perpetuate it other than our silent complacency. We sell our freedom for some semblance of safety and the diaphanous concept of an establishment.\n\nThe world around us is an extension of the world inside of us. When we do wrong, we are only doing it to ourselves. I think our whole world has got cancer... and it could even look as thought it's dying, although I hope its getting better. If you look at satellite shots of the world and look at our major cities and the pollution cloud that engulfs them, our poor world even looks like it has cancers growing on it.\n\nThinking about thinking and the thoughts we choose to entertain is something we all need to do carefully. Ever since reading As A Man Thinketh I've been realizing more and more how our thoughts create our reality. I think As a Man Thinketh should be compulsory reading for the whole human race. The more I think about it the more it makes sense.\n\n4. Has this book challenged or changed your thinking in any way? If so, explain how?\n\nThis book has entirely changed my thinking and now I look at life from a totally different standpoint, one where I can see how I am in complete control of my circumstances. Now when I look at seemingly problematic situations I ask myself why and how I have created the situation and I ask what can be learned from the situation. Reading this book has helped me to see that when planned situations do not come together as intended, I think we should remember that the perfect thing has happened at the perfect time to teach us exactly what we need to know for the greater good of everybody. Why was the outcome the most ideal thing that could have happened? If we create our circumstances then we obviously create them for a reason and by looking for that reason we can see how our circumstances serve to benefit us, no matter what they are.\n\nI now realize how important it is to be selective with the thoughts I allow myself to entertain. Oftentimes I am quite unsure of where the thoughts in my head come from, but now when I find myself thinking something less than constructive I stop and reword my inner dialog to shape a more positive feeling.\n\nHe who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it"

Here, the science is less \"convincing\" than in Jurrassic Park (which is mostly convincing, but stretched) and Prey (which is better writing and fun, but not convincing). But that doesn't matter, because Crichton can write an adventure like few others (as long as character isn't important--character's here take backseat to concept and science). Pace, as always is good. More a rollicking adventure than \"something to think about\" (typical of later novels) and quite enjoyable on that level.

      "review_text": "This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.\n\nOnce the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.\n\nThis novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this."

      "review_text": "Bryan Garner brings clarity and insight to the confounding world of legal writing.  \"Legal Writing in Plain English\" contains dozens of comments and guidelines that should be burned into the brain of every attorney.  Some of these are obvious (e.g., use a readable typeface), while others are more nuanced (e.g., delete perhaps the legal drafter's favorite legalism, \"provided that\").  Each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal -- be a good writer so that your reader doesn't have to work so darn hard to understand you.\n\nAs everyone knows, a simple manual of rules can be maddeningly dull and preachy.  Garner has enlivened his book by including a number of practical exercises so that the reader can put these guidelines into practice before the next memo or brief.  These exercises range from \"basic\" to \"advanced,\" and are well worth the time.\n\nAfter reading this book (and attending Mr. Garner's one-day seminar), I submit that this book should be required reading for every One-L and associate."

      "review_text": "Bryan A. Garner is leading what might be a Quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear, clean, unambiguous and even interesting prose.  This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage.  The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong.  He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it.  If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn't get to a judge.  They'd likely settle.  And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were &quot;traditionally drafted.&quot;  And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause.  That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople.  The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language.  Legal writing is written in English, the same English used to buy groceries, talk lovingly to your spouse, and complain to the doctor about what ails you.  There is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson, other than lawyers' need to feel like they're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana.  And the writer's praise of &quot;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary&quot; as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement:  &quot;DESPITE anything in this agreement to the contrary . . . .&quot;  Garner is a brilliant, insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use.  We know what happens with legalese:  litigation and contention and noncomprehension.  Give plain English a try, with Garner as your guide to Aquinas's trinity of wholeness, harmony, radiance, and of course clarity clarity clarity"

I did get frustrated in the end with Deanna and her reasoning behind not contacting Ben about the baby. The visual descriptions make you feel like you're really there. I liked the fact that Danielle and Ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and didn't play games about their feelings. The ending is a let down though. The epilogue should have been set a few years down the road. I loved it when Marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the poor editing and the not-so-great ending.  Would reccomend"

She met Ben Thompson and found fullfillment with him; Marc-Edouard was already having an affair with a woman named Chantal. I thought that he was a jerk for doing that to Deanna. But when it was all said and done and when I finished reading the book, Deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was Ben's. At last she could have a happy life with someone. Keep up the good work, Danielle!"

I chose 5 stars because it has been 2 weeks since I finished the book and I'm still thinking about it.  Why I even entertained 4 stars is because the characters committed adultery.  From the very begining you can tell that this was going to happen and I didn't like that betrayal was involved.  As I continued to read the book, I fell in love with Ben.

As a reader, you can see how these companies needed Sandy's pivotal instincts to solve their problems and evolve."

The Journal breaks these stories over and over again, and other news organizations simply trail in their wake.  Monica Langley is one of these trailblazers.  In 'Tearing Down the Walls,' she expands upon a lengthy Page A1 profile she had written about Sandy Weill and details his Horatio Alger story.\n\nThe title refers to how Weill \"had torn down one wall after another - barriers based on religion, class, even the law - to get to where he was.\"  The cover blurbs refer to this book as 'riveting' (Forbes) and 'rollicking' (The Economist).  That seems close to impossible for a business book, but 'Walls' is a well-written tale of a larger-than-life character.  You'll blast through these 438 pages effortlessly.\n\nIt's also worth noting that based on Langley's reporting, Chuck Prince earned his stripes and was duly rewarded in getting tabbed as Weill's successor.  And, Bank One (and now Chase) made a great choice in naming Jamie Dimon as its CEO.  Dimon leaps off the page as the Crown Prince of Wall Street. Langley is clearly taken with the guy's obvious charisma and skills (Dimon seems to have this effect on everyone throughout the course of the book)."

What emerges is a picture of a man who is fiercely ambitious and terrifyingly astute - but  also seriously flawed.\n\nProne to fits of rage, Weill regularly unleashes streams of expletives on petrified subordinates, sometimes reducing them to tears.  He is quick to punish close lieutenants foolish enough to evince the slightest bit of disloyalty.  And his laser-like focus on cost-cutting tends to sow disaffection among employees.\n\nBut he is also something of an enigma.  Despite his fearsome temper, he has a tremendous capacity for empathy, often moved to tears upon learning of the plight of others.  Shy and unassertive in his early days, he later metamorphoses into a self-assured and forceful leader.\n\nLangley is a skilled raconteur and her silken prose is a pleasure to read.  Her ability to glean the finer details of Weill's life is also impressive.  Without a doubt, this is one of the best business books of the year"

      "reviewer_location": "",
      "review_text": "The author could have done much more with her subject.  Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character.  For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive.  At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet.  Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly?  Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual.  But the author never treats him as such.\n\nIn the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter's of Weill's life and career.  To sew the articles together into a coherent story, the author suggests that Weill's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the WASPy Wall Street powerbrokers who won't let a Jew join their club.  Perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven Weill for the past 40 years.  But it raises interesting questions that the author doesn't address.\n\nI'm a Jew in finance and Jews have been very well-represented on Wall Street for some time now.  Weill is presented as having been driven to create Citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the WASPy Wall Street club.  But by this point we're into the nineties and any exclusive WASPy club had long since been abolished.  So all of a sudden Weill comes off as pathologically insecure, which is intriguing.  But the author doesn't elaborate.\n\nThis is a good book if you want a run down of Sandy Weill's career.  No other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place.  But all that information confirms that Weill himself is a very complex man; to do her complex subject justice, the author would have had to do much more with this book"

Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We recommended Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative"

I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there.  This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader.\nThis book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun.  How exciting!  The plot was wonderful, the characters were likable, the villians were nasty.  This is one book that I am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat, and I will read it again when the cold starts setting in, so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure."

      "review_text": "First, let me say that while I have read many of Nora Roberts books, more often than not I am somewhat disappointed.  While she is always a reliable read, her stories tend to be very formulaic, and too often forgettable.  I picked up The Reef almost by accident at a friend's, for lack of anything else to read.  Having read a few of Nora's books before, my expectations weren't that high; I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the predictability of her other books, this one went against convention in many ways, while still developing a satisfying romance and mystery.  Generally Nora sacrifices an intriguing plot for the central relationship, but she balances the two beauifully here.  Not only did she create an intriguing villain, but the love story was touching.  As other readers have said, I liked how she spread it out over the years, which made it slightly more realistic, and somehow much sweeter at the end.  The development of secondary characters was also a welcome change from typical Nora.  In short, if you're not typically a Nora Roberts fan, give this one a try!  Not the best romantic suspsense I've ever encountered, but definetly worth the read"

      "review_text": "I can't say enough good things about THE REEF! It shows a strong female character in a field that used to be dominated by men, and a strong sensitive male that isn't afraid to dream.\n\nThis is a fantasy come true and involves marine archeologist Tate Beaumont and Matthew Lassiter and their families. The families run into each other while treasure-hunting for Angelique's Curse - a treasure that has eluded everyone, and many think it is only a myth. But this artifact is worth everything to some, even worth killing another.\n\nAs this joint expedition continues, it holds all of the elements needed for a great story: mystery, romance, secrets that can't be shared, deceptions and threats. There are so many angles that could have been pursued the reader isn't sure which avenue Nora Roberts will take until she delivers them to it. This always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and gives you a first hand \"view\" of the undersea world of beauty and intrigue.\n\nI highly recommend THE REEF and only wish it would have continued - or at least had a sequel in the works! Great characters and fantastic plot will hook the reader from the beginning. One of Nora Roberts better works!"

      "review_text": "This excellent package comes with both the hardcopy and digital PDA version of Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses, the best drug guide which I have used.\n\nHow many errors could be alleviated if more nurses looked up their meds?! However, since on most units, medbooks are only available in the medroom and a medbook is too bulky to carry in most cases, the sad fact is that meds are not looked up. My first PDA drug guide was Mosby's, which I have had for over a year; I now also own Davis's. I cannot tell you how many nurses have asked me to quickly look up their meds to see check on dosages, adverse reactions, or nursing considerations. More than one time the meds have been held or orders questioned as a result, but had I not been in the room, the med likely would have been given. How nice it is to have an entire med book electronically available in your pocket, searchable by both generic and brand names (no more flipping through indexes trying to find the generic name), always accessible.\n\nSo now you are convinced of the necessity of owning a PDA drug guide, but which one should you buy. Like I said, I have owned Mosby's Drug Guide for over a year and have just recently purchased Davis. I have found Davis's drug guide to be more thorough. Davis is also easier to navigate. Both Davis and Mosby have drop-down menus to quickly jump to the desired section of the med-entry (i.e. mechanism of action, adverse reactions/side effects, compatibility, nursing considerations, client education, etc); however since Davis has the content divided into more subsections, it is quicker to navigate to the desired content. So, my personal choice is Davis; however I do not think you would be remiss to purchase either of these. I only encourage you to move out of the hard-copy med-book and to the PDA version.\n\nYou may also like to know that you can integrate many other helpful resources such as lab value guides (such as Pagana & Pagana's Diagnostic Laboratory Test Reference, ISBN 0323033954; or the one included in Medical-Surgical Nursing Clinical Companion, ISBN 0323031994), medical dictionaries (Like Taber's, ISBN 080361408X), and more. I hope that more nurses are walking around with entire reference libraries in their pockets resulting in better practice, improved patient outcomes, and reduced errors.\n\nhttp://www.hantla.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=20"

It is listed under generic names but if you don't know the generic name you can look up in the index at the back of the book for the trade name.  I had a nurse/lawyer professor for my first year care plans and she wanted it all.  This book delivered it ALL: classification, pregnancy catagory, indications, mechanism of action, contraindications and precautions, adverse reactions and side effects, interactions, route and dosage, availability, nursing implications and even potential nursing diagnoses! Also implementation, patient/family teaching and evaluation.  Wow! I've been very impressed.  It came through for me so I didn't have to go out and buy another drug book which is saying something! Davis's Drug Guide has even more in the back of the book with many appendixes including: recent drug approvals, additional drugs, combination drugs and opthalmic meds all that  include class, indications, adverse reactions and side effects, route and dosage and contraindications and warnings.  Appendix E  is about natural/herbal products which is as thorough as the drugs that make up the main part of this book.  There are pictures of the intramuscular drug sites, formulas helpful for calculating doses, routine pediatric and adult immunizations,  recommendations for the safe handling of hazardous drugs, schedules of controlled substances, food sources for specific nutrients (ie foods rich in K, Na, Ca, Fe, vit K, vit D, low Na, foods that acidify urine as well as foods that alkalizine urine), and insulin and insulin therapy.  Also throughout the book there is plenty of red lettering amidst the black for high alert warnings where drug overdoses have occurred in the past.  The organized, easily found references in this guide could save your client's lives.  Just because a doctor orders it doesn't mean it is ok to give, as a nurse we have to look it up and know the safe dose and contraindications and more and this book has it all! Highly recommended! Good luck all future nurses!\nSoar!"

This year (Fall 2005) as a senior, I wanted to get an updated drug guide, so I asked my Adult II instructor what she recommended, and purchased it. It was from another company, and was in shrink wrap, so I did not look at it before I purchased. The company is very reputable, but I found that the layout and content of the book not as extensive as Davis's. That was $35 down the tubes! I would like to see a newer editon of Davis's that covers the many new drugs. As soon as I do, I will purchase"

      "review_text": "Bill Rancic, the dashing winner of the first season of  Donald Trump's runaway-hit reality show The Apprentice admits on the back sleeve of his book You're Hired: How to Succeed in Business and Life that he never went to business school and that he doesn't believe that business theory can be learned from a book.  What then is the affable Mr. Rancic doing offering advice on good and  ethical business practices?  Making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame, that's what.  In two hundred pages, he lays out the formula for his own success that led to him beat out 215,000 applicants to become the Donald's first `Apprentice.'  The reader is privy to Mr. Rancic's early entrepreneurial efforts, businesses that whet his appetite for something larger.  Readers are also witness to his failures and mishaps that threatened to derail his ambition.  Through it all, Rancic recounts the lessons he's learned, persons he's admired, falls from which he's risen.  He offers opinions on Kwame Jackson, his fellow runner-up to the Apprentice title, and `deceitful' Omarosa, whom many believed was the cause of Jackson's loss.  He also details lessons he's learned on goals, values, strategies, leadership, vision, and success.  While business school grads may scoff at Rancic's straight-shooting and simplistic advice, it is less idealistic than The One Minute Manager series of books.  Here, Rancic seems to be offering advice to the everyman and everywoman looking to get a better hold on the direction and management of their lives in pursuit of their goals and dreams.  The result is one that is as memorable, yet as pleasing, as a tall glass of lemonade."

This fortuitous mix of \"apple pie\" ingrediants have garnered him national fame, and this book outlines his experiences (along with the lessons he learnt along the way) that propelled him to be The Apprentice.\n\nThe accounts of his experiences are modern day fables, with the moral of the story encapsulated as life lessons at the end of each chapter. In addition, each chapter contains vignettes of wisdom boxed in grey shading. Many of these are commonsense admonitions we've been hearing all our lives to the point that they have become cliches.  Rancic shows that these tried and true maxims of the American dream still apply.\n\nI gave the book four stars for two reasons. One, the editing is sloppy. Writing a book in a conversational tone does not override the need for proper grammar. Two, Rancic's references to himself sometimes tend to sound smarmy (as when he refers to himself as \"master chef\" in the pancake story from his childhood and later when he calls himself an eligible bachelor).Somehow, this takes away from his self-characterization as humble. Such relatively minor flaws aside, this is a book worth reading."

He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth).\n\nAfter reading this book I had a better understanding of where the Conservatives are coming from, althohgh I still don't understand why an obscure Royalist politician from the 18th century should be their flag bearer. Royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the US, although we seem to flirt with it from time to time.\n\nConservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy, as we currently have in the US: they would rather rely on accidents of birth, cronyism and college organizations to select administrators, rather than people who have succeeded in other venues. A very informative, albeit frightening, book."

      "review_text": "This book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking. It is not very difficult to go online and read any number of Conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day. But, this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of Conservative intellectuals. Often times it is portrayed (not without some merit) that Conservatives are anti-intellectual. I have frequently heard that Liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual. But, The Conservative Mind blows a hole through all of that. Kirk examines major Conservative thinkers like: Edmund Burke, John Adams, George Canning, Benjamin Disraeli, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, and T. S Eliot (amung many many others).\n\nThe most difficult aspect of this book is to accept John Randolph and John Calhoun as figures to be celebrated. They both were men who used their talents to protect an evil system of slavery. Although, as another reviewer elquently noted, Kirk was not endnorsing slavery or racism or anything like that. Just the fact that Conservatism is a The \"negation of ideology,\" and that change will happen, in Kirk's prospective Calhoun was only following that line of thinking. I personally don't agree with it that far. As obviously slavery was antithesis of what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution stand for. But, again stating, Kirk is not writing to argue that slavery should not have been eliminated- only that change has to follow the methods of that society.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone- Conservative or Liberal. It is a magifnicent study of Conservativism. It can be a little dense at times, but that is to be expected and it shouldn't detour anyone from reading it."

      "reviewer_location": "South Euclid, Ohio USA",
      "review_text": "The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, \"[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man\".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.\n\nThere are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, \"What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well\" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.\n\nAnother thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, \"state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law\". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.\n\nThe third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.\n\nIn order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete fa\u001aade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day."

But I do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer.  The caricature to which I refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change.  In fact, the reviewer even argued that the Soviet Union could have been seen as a \"conservative\" system (an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media).\n\nPerhaps the reviewer missed or didn't understand Kirk's repeated references to conservatism as the \"negation of ideology.\"  An ideologist is anyone who tries to rubber-stamp a system of premade ideas onto a society or culture.  Think of the \"New Soviet Man\" in the Soviet Union.  Think of the \"Cultural Revolution\" in China.  For that matter, although it wasn't imposed militarily, think of the \"Great Society\" in America (it worked out about as well as the first two).\n\nThe \"negation of ideology,\" then, is the conservative idea that one takes societies as one finds them, and then tries to work out change organically from within those societies, rather than imposing it on them from the top.  (Think of the current liberal infatuation with attempting to rule America through the Supreme Court for a good example of the \"imposing from the top\" model.)  Sometimes this change can be quite radical, radical in the sense of \"getting to the roots\" of something, as in the American Revolution (which Kirk discusses extensively).  The colonists believed that the liberty they already knew was being circumscribed, and fought to extend it.\n\nThe reviewer also slanders Kirk in implying he would be in favor of accepting slavery.  No, our own Constitution details life and liberty for all, and the organic application of it (as we see in our subsequent history) extends that life and liberty to all.  Even the writers of the Constitution, some of whom owned slaves themselves, knew that the Constitution's principles would lead to freedom for all.  Lincoln (a Republican, let's never forget) certainly knew it.\n\nIf you really want to know about the intellectual history of conservatism, this book is where to start.  Don't be put off by reviewers whose lack of sympathy for the subject leads them as well to a lack of understanding of the subject."

      "review_text": "Kirk starts off with 6 basic tendencies that define conservatism.  Among them:\nPessimism.  Conservatives do not trust human beings to seek the good.  We believe human beings are concupiscent, and that government, as an institution made up of concupiscent human beings, is untrustworthy and corrupt.  A liberal believes human beings are essentially good.  Modern \"liberalism,\" aka socialism, having failed to prove any of its theories as to where evil comes from, has turned cynical.  There is a difference between healthy pessimism and cynicism.\nAnyway, Kirk begins by outlining 6 key points of conservative thought (which are forgotten by our current liberal Republican president).  Then he discusses the major thinkers who defined conservatism from the late 18th to early 20th centuries"

It is a book that should not be taken lightly. The very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. A must have in every library. It is in mine"

While it does have magical elements, it is not full of \"Harry Potter\" magic if people are lead here by JK Rowling's comments.  It is more fanciful and mysterious, with a little bit of chaste romance thrown in -- a perfect escape from the real world for a bit.  It sounds like a movie is being made, which intrigues me.  I can't wait to see how it translates to the big screen.  Altogether, it was an absolutely lovely book, one I am going to recommend to others to read -- 'tween, teen, or adult"

Let children read and enjoy the story.  After all, it is not meant to entertain adults.\n\nSilver horses, magic, and peculiar circustances don't need to alarm the children who read the book or see the movie.  I, for one, am anxious to see how this story is transformed for the screen.  I will let my imagination run free with the little white horse, and simply enjoy the movie as pure and delightful amusement.\n\nI recommend this book for children to enjoy and anticipate the plot as the storyline develops.

Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one"

      "review_text": "I recently purchased a new copy of this book. I read it years ago, in 7th grade.  I enjoyed the book the second time and I'm glad I have it for my future children to read someday.  The story is a pretty heartwarming one.  Everyone gets along pretty well and there really isn't too much unhappiness in it.  Everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt.  This is mainly a story about learning to compromise.  I would recommend this book for children (primarily girls, since the main character is a girl) ages 10-13.  Younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them.  It's a nice story for adults too, for the child within.  It's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a \"dog\", and the unicorn as just a \"little white horse\".  I must say that I prefer the picture on the cover of the first book I read.  It was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn.  I think that one was much prettier than the current cover art.\n\nAlso, a suggestion for parents or teachers...when I originally read this book, it was for a school book report.  Part of the assignment was to create a board game that went along with the book.  It was actually kind of fun, though maybe these days 12 an 13 year olds may not enjoy it as much as I did."

Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.\n\nIt all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.\n\nUltimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader."

Among the funnier characters, there are Lenore's violently jealous boss who is coincedently her lover; Wang-dang-lang, a friend from college; and Norman Bombardini, an obscenely obese lone-wolf with an unhealthy obsession for Lenore.\n\nAlthough there are really no key plots, the story is never dull and a lot of the short stories within the book (critiqued by none other then Lenore's boss who runs a publishing company) are reason enough alone to buy this paperback edition.\n\nAlthough I think the ending was overly abrupt, it fits in well with the context of the character, especially considering his apparent fixation on \"words\" (the word itself is the word that should appear as the last word in the book, if this made any sense to you whatsoever).\n\nNonetheless, this book is a definite must have for any Wallace fan, and an excellent introduction to him which will not give you a workout every time you pick it up to read like the hefty \"Infinite Jest\" undoubtedly will.\n\nblog.myspace.com/mattyp24"

I became interested in reading the late 20th century \"greats\" and began with Infinite Jest. One hundred pages later, I was sufficiently confused and decided to back off and read some early or shorter works by my authors of interest. Thus, I read Delillo's Body Artist and DFWs Broom of the System. Despite the fact that DFW is clearly more intelligent than me, I managed to finish the Broom of the System. It is more approachable than Infinite Jest, funny, and entertaining. If you are new to DFW, I would say that this book has a similar \"feel\" as the films The Royal Tenenbaums or I Heart Huckabees.  Is this a perfect book? No. Is the writing outstanding? Yes - but not completely perfected. Is the plot compelling? No - then The Historian and DaVinci Code are compelling but thats all they offer. What is it that makes this book worth 4 stars? It is simply DFWs ability to capture the irony and lassitude that characterized the youth zeitgeist of the late 20th century. He does this with humor and zest that are rarely matched. It may be DFWs lack of driving plot that makes people so frustrated. However, recall that the \"Greatest American Novel,\" Moby Dick was panned commercially and critically when first published. Was Melville ahead of the collective curve? Probably. Is DFW also ahead of the curve? Given the equal number of people who dislike or love his writing, it is not unlikely. Either way, The Broom of the System offers an approachable starting point to one of the great writers of our time. March onward, Delillo, Wallace, and Pynchon"

The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental \"Tragedy and Hope\".)\nTo all the \"if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!\" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show \"Alien Nation\" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow \"fringe\" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.\nI'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to \"Pale Horse\". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that \"Behold a Pale Horse\" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible."

There is also lots and I mean lots of conservative dupes. I'd say Bill is eccentric and some of this book is blather. To dismiss it on the whole because of a couple of space cadet ramblings would be wrong. There is concrete proof that there is a cabal of men in high places mainly the international bankers who are bent on world control and domination. Their arm is the unconstitutional private bank the Federal Reserve who has a strangle hold on the econmy and can cause recessions and depressions with edicts. Do your homework and you'll see the crash of 29' was no accident. The IRS is also illegal so is the income tax which is used to pay the interest on the debt to the international bankers. Now I don't know about the Illuminati  or Skull and Bones stuff but it is a big possibilty that their connected. This book covers it all. Not for establishment liberals or conservatives who wish to believe whats on the surface. This is for people like me who want to dig where the dirt, slime and worms are. As for Bill's death its up in the air there is a possibilty that the cops shot him because he shot first. Theres also the other that the authorites shot him as a undesirable and some say the court records concur with this. Either way this book is a good and informative read."

You can't really take the book as proven fact, though, as Cooper has mentioned this in a disclaimer in the front of the book, himself.\n\n\"Behold A Pale Horse\" is really just a collection of information that Cooper had been distributing for many years. He faxed news letters, held public lectures and debates, and dedicated his life and perhaps even his death to revealing the truth about the people that rule our nation, and possibly our world.\n\nIf he's not \"one of them\", as he states several times in the book, then William Cooper is a true hero.. or puppet, I'm really not sure. The thing that I liked about the book, though, was that he simply proposes several \"conclusions\" through-out the book, based on whatever information he'd found.\n\nHe attempted to verify everything that he came across, and I think that Cooper honestly felt like he had a real chance at hendering whatever might be coming. However, what affects might this book have had on the world? If you're on a search for truth, this book is the origin of a lot of the information that people will hand you. I couldn't even begin to think about all of the ways that this book, alone, might have inspired people. Heh, or the number of watch lists I could have put myself on for posting this review."

Like most 'success' based books the concepts in here won't make your jaw drop in shock and awe as they are all essentially pretty simple - Think Success and Gain Success. The belief in your ability to achieve something is the first and most important step towards success. Believing you can, will spur your mind to support your belief with reasons, it will find a HOW so you can achieve your goal. Conversely, if you believe you can't, your mind will find reasons to support your claim,\n\nThe application is always the challenge but this book definitely inspires you to tap into the innate potential within. Coincidentally this book arrived a few days before I had an important job interview and put me in the success frame of mind. I passed the first interview easily, nailed the second one and got the job! It's the sort of book you will read again and again to keep the concepts fresh in your mind. It's also a book you will want to lend people you care about.\n\nHighly reccommended. Buy it!"

But the results of following the advice given by Dr. Schwartz might seem like magic.\n\nThe simple truth is that most people have very self-limiting beliefs.  And as a result, think in terms of small achievements.  Change your way of thinking and you change your life.  As Schwartz points out, success is achieved \"by following conscientiously and continuously a plan for self-development and growth.\"  And he gives you a plan.\n\nThe book is well written, full of interesting stories and great advice.  If you implement just a few of the ideas he puts forward, you will make considerable improvement in your life.\n\nSome of the more notable bits of wisdom:\n\n\"We learn nothing from telling.  But there is no limit to what we can learn by asking and listening.\"\n\n\"Others see in us what we see in ourselves.\"\n\n\"People who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people ...\"\n\n\"Before you start out, know where you want to go.\"\n\nThe book contains a wealth of great information and wisdom.  However like any great advice, it is useless unless and until the reader takes action.  For the words to benefit you, you must take action.  A great blueprint for taking action, but taking action is up to the reader."

In preparing to bet the Kentucky Derby and other races this year I read Andrew Beyer's fantastic book \"Beyer on Speed\" and Joe Cardello's book \"Speed to Spare\".  These two books fundamentally changed the way I handicap races. It is simply careless to handicap races without understanding Beyer Speed Ratings and use them to your advantage. This book explains the origins of the Beyer Speed figures and walks you through an understanding of how the speed figures are calculated and how they work. I used the information on \"Beyer on Speed\" and \"Speed to Spare\" this year (March, 2005) to hit a big trifecta at Santa Anita - without Beyer Speed ratings and the information they provide, I would have never made the bet I made.\n\nAndrew Beyer is not only a great author, but he is at the forefront of making a day at the races enjoyable to all.  \"Beyer on Speed\" is a book that will absolutely make your trip to the track more enjoyable than you can imagine.  Beyer doesn't sugar-coat the various elements that make handicapping a less-than-perfect science, but he does help you understand the fundamentals in a very concise way.\n\nI appreciate Andrew Beyer's commitment to racing/handicapping that is so evident in this book and in all his other writings. Andrew Beyer remains at the forefront of the war against doping in racing and other honesty/integrity issues. Andrew Beyer is one of the reasons that horse racing is such a great sport. This book is for anyone wanting to know how to quickly understand the joys and pitfalls of handicapping - and why thorougbred racing is so much fun."

I wish he would write a handicapping book that would have racing forms for 4 or 5 days, then show you how they break down the races to make their selections, not with programs they want to sell.

While his first book introduced speed figures, and his second mixed the application of them with an appreciation of other aspects of handicapping, this book revisits the holistic approach - always emphasizing speed figures - in an era when everyone has access to more information than ever, and many even know how to use it.  What makes reading Beyer so fascinating is that one is made to see, vividly, the endless testing and working out of new ideas and approaches, in the stories - one might call them lessons - he recounts (the chapter on turf betting is a classic of sports writing).  Beyer, like Bill James, is a scientist, and thinks like one, to the edification of all who choose not to keep recycling the same old bromides, and making the same old mistakes.  People like Beyer and Steve Davidowitz are largely responsible for the ever-escalating arms race which parimutuel bettors are fighting amongst themselves.  It's a wonderful game, but if you don't want to get left behind, better read this"

Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.\nSecondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's \"Number One Bestseller\" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a \"bestseller\".\n\nThe major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.\nBrad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's \"deep dark secret\" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.\n\nHalfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again..."

The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it"

Both of her daughters are no longer at home and it's not until she meets up with a childhood friend Brad that she begins to see what she could have. Coming back from a trip a day early she finds out that her husband has been unfaithful to her and she finds hope for her future in the childhood friend named Brad whom happens to be married. Faith and Brad get closer as time goes by and the rest is a fairytale come true. In my opinion this book was one of  D.S.'s best"

This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.

Julien's strengths are in the area of legitimate,  prescription use; i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less  complete.  the chapter on psychedelics is, unfortunately,  nigh-on-useless--errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book.    this book has been an indespensible reference for me"

The  writing is clear, concise, informative, interesting, and complete.  Each  chapter gives an overview of the family of drugs and then goes into detail  on a few of the most common examples.  Everything from delivery to  half-life to molecular action to side effects is  covered.  Many of my  friends went out and bought the book after looking at my copy to learn  about either their recreational habits or prescription drugs.  A background  in biology would be useful for understanding all of the information, but  there are also appendices which explain the basics"

      "review_text": "Susan Scott has written an outstanding book on how to use everyday conversation to cut through the politics of work relationships and start talking about what we are all \"pretending not to know\".  I was consistently impacted while reading it, not so much that the material is brand new, but that it is presented in such a way that the opportunities and misses of my own interactions were obvious.\n\nOne of the topics discussed is called \"Mineral Rights\", a type of conversation designed to get deep, past the surface and into the truth of what is going on.  The approach accomplishes four purposes:  Interrogate reality, provoke learning, tackle tough challenges, and enrich relationships.  It has been my experience that this rarely happens in corporate America, and is rarer still where I work now.  The book uses examples from various companies that have identified their core values and been honest enough with themselves and others to start acting on them.  The many questions posed throughout the book, and the sections at the end of each chapter are a great way to start interrogating reality in your workplace.   The answers usually are \"in the room\" if we can really get honest and start looking for them.\n\nIn addition to some great business council, much of the book focuses on how we get honest with ourselves.  Often we are the problem, and our own inability to truly understand where our own issues lie, is an essential journey to better facilitate the kind of change we want in our business or relationships.  Another great approach used is the \"Decision Tree\" to help build empowerment in others.  Communicate clearly what decisions can be made and what must be communicated to others.  (Page 252).  Her insights into how silence is an effective communication tool, both internally and in interactions with others, were right on.\n\nWhile this was all excellent, and perhaps the most well written summary of engaging communication approaches, what was the most powerful for me were the sections on our \"emotional wake\".  We all leave an emotional wake behind us as we engage in conversations with people.  The question is, what kind of wake do we want to leave?  How do we want people to feel?  This served as a great wake up call for me while reading.\n\nOverall, this book is so full of great wisdom and insights I couldn't begin to do it justice here.   From the opening examples to the very useful questions in the back and the study guides throughout, I believe this to be one of the best books on business and personal communication I have read.  It is both deep and practical, both academically sound and real world tested, and is written in such a way that it felt like a conversation itself.  Highly recommended!"

      "review_text": "Scott Ritter and Seymour Hersh have made at least two appearances at The New York Society for Ethical Culture in the past year to discuss US foreign policy issues concerning Iraq and more recently Iran.  The October 16, 2006 appearance covered the issues of Mr. Ritter's current book Target Iran.  Transcripts and podcasts are available.\n\nIt is Mr. Ritter's contention that the Busch administration's primary tool of foreign policy is that of regime change.  Any efforts by those nations that are so targeted to engage us in diplomacy have and will be rebuffed.  This administration will not talk to those it considers it's enemies.  This has been challenged in the media by the James Baker group, but it remains to be seen if they will effect any changes.\n\nTarget Iran, according to Mr. Ritter, in based on press coverage in the Middle East and private confirmation of those stories by members of our intelligence community.  The story is that America is already working inside Iran with dissidents to identify targets.  We are also said to be negotiating the details of staging areas for our base of attack for this widening of the Middle East war.  Once that is completed, this administration intends to attack.\n\nThe public is and will be sold the same scenario in which (ala Downing Street memo), the facts will be fixed around the policy.\n\nWhy will this happen?  One element is the influence of Israel.  Iran is perceived, and not incorrectly, as a major threat to Israel.  But Ritter makes the point that Israeli and American interests are not identical.  After the recent events in Southern Lebanon, watching our congress and our administration give their complete support to whatever Israel was going to do, it's hard to see much separation.\n\nWhatever the threat to us from Iran, Mr. Ritter says it's very much overblown at this point and should not lead to war.  Iran, according to Ritter, approached this administration several years ago to normalize relations and limit it's nuclear research.  They were rebuffed.  Mr. Busch can only visualize regime change.\n\nIf this goes forward as Mr. Hersh and Ritter both seem to think is inevitable, what are the chances of success?  According to these gentlemen, the results will be utter catastrophe.  Iran will immediately shut off the oil spigot.  Venezuela will create a hemispheric crisis by acting in sympathy and fail to honor their US contracts.  US troops in Iraq will be under attack by the Shia and possibly because of a religious fatwa in response to our attack.  Iranian missiles will be directed against the Saudi oil fields to further disrupt the world markets.  The world economy will be plunged into a massive recession.  This could lead to a ground invasion of US troops most likely from Uzbekistan that could easily turn into a trap.  Our ground troops are seriously depleted and under equipped at this point already.  Here is where Ritter says this administration could use field grade nuclear weapons to break the back of Iran.  He thinks this is the ultimate deal breaker because it absolutely assures us that radical Arabs will find a way over time to deliver a nuclear bomb to an American city.\n\nThese scenarios seem outlandish, except there are so many radical Republican sources cheering on war with Iran, that one cannot expect this administration to not once again respond with a military solution as the first order of business.  Of course, they visualize success not the failure predicted by Ritter.\n\nThe massive failure of our government during Katrina and the fiasco in Iraq are both symptoms of the same problems in the Busch administration.  What if war with Iran leads to the doomsday scenario that Ritter and Hersh talk about.  This book is a sober assessment of these issues and should be read widely by the public.\n\nThe potential of a Democratic House of Representatives in the near future will not change the scenario described by Ritter.  American militarism is ascendant.  As Ritter says, if the war in Iraq were going well, the public would be very satisfied.  The fact that the war is against all tenets of international law and was an immoral act on our part is not something that most of us seem to worry about.  Too many Democrats only talk about running a competent war"

Scott Ritter provides important, but tangential, information related to Israel's influence over U.S. foreign policy, the history of the IAEA in Iran, and the theory of regime change as the real reason for U.S. \"concern\" over Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Ritter misses on two counts. First, he offers little direct insight into the Bush administration's policy-making process. And second, someone forgot to edit the book. We are talking about gross grammatical errors, periods in the middle of a sentence, and even a sentence that is punctuated with both a question mark and a period. It is painful to read some of the paragraphs because they are so poorly constructed (at first, I thought my eyes were tired).\n\nAt least this book attempts to offer something better than the pablum provided by major media and NPR. It does provide some real insights into the workings of the IAEA, Israeli intelligence and exiled leaders-in-waiting who often lead U.S. policy astray.\n\nMr. Ritter is at his best when he stays close to his area of expertise - weapons inspections. This topic requires far more than that"

Interesting Asana is fine for those who are truly moved and have a body that is capible of accomplishing it, but the real goal of yoga is to help you do a practice that enhances your life, not to spend your life trying to accomplish gymnastics designed for young Indian boys. For a different view, take a look at \"The Yoga of Heart\" by Mark Whitwell."

I have been doing Ashtanga yoga for 3 years now and have been inspired by David's Primary Series DVD and this book since I first began my practice.\n\nFor anyone who does not have Ashtanga experience, cannot find a teacher in their area or want to practice outside of a yoga class, David's DVDs are incredible and instructive.  This book is an excellent companion to learn the finer points of the practice at your own pace.\n\nThis book is also phenomenal for those experienced in Ashtanga who want to create a Mysore practice.  A Mysore practice is a quiet practice.  The only sound is your breath, while you go through the sequence at your own pace.  It's a profound opportunity to \"hear your own voice\" and in my experience, builds a deep inner trust.  Swenson's book not only lets you look at one asana at a time, but it also provides an \"at-a-glance\" sequence for a kind of \"cliff notes\" effect.  This was excellent to have by my mat as a reminder of the sequence while creating my at-home Mysore practice.\n\nI have had the great fortune to take a class and teacher training with David Swenson.  He has a down-to-earth style, humor and an incredible knowledge of Ashtanga that shines through in his book and DVDs.  I highly recommend his work to anyone interested in Ashtanga yoga."

It explains each posture in both the Primary and Intermediate Series in simple to understand language. Plus, David Swenson includes various modifications for difficult poses, which is always helpful.\nAlso included in this book are a few short practices sequenced togethery by Swenson, lasting 15, 30 & 45 minutes. These are excellent as well!\nThis is a wonderful Ashtanga book that any yogi or yogini who practices Ashtanga needs to own! Good for all levels - beginner through expert. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

My only wish for the book would be that it would contain a fold-out page with a diagram of the whole series on one page so that it could be a quick reference rather than having to flip from page to page. It would make moving through the series much easier after one has gotten the basics down. Also, (Ok, I have one more wish)I appreciated the break down of the Sanskrit word into meanings, but it would be even better with a pronounciation guide too. Otherwise, it is nearly perfect"

      "review_text": "Alterman tries to deny the obvious left-wing bias of the media through fallacious arguments. For one, he compares complaints of liberal bias with complaints about media bias against minorities. In actuality, at one time, minorities were in fact seldom shown on TV, and then almost always in negative, stereotyped roles (e. g., black maids, Asian coolies). But those times have changed. Not so with the liberal bias. In fact, I sensed the liberal bias of the media even as a child, long before I knew what a liberal even was. I saw the constant glorification of hippies and those who protested the war in Vietnam, while there was complete silence on the cruelties of the Communists. At that time, I wondered why. Now I know.\n\nAlterman tries vainly to ridicule the expose of liberal media bias by stating that there would have to be some sort of conspiracy in order for there to be a bias. In actuality, since most journalists are liberals, no conspiracy of any kind is necessary for a liberal bias to exist. Liberals simply do what comes naturally to them. As it stands, when a new set of Democratic phraseology arises, it almost simultaneously is spoken also by members of the mainstream media. This proves that there is some degree of organized collusion between the media and the Democratic party.\n\nEvery election cycle, it is the same. Every charge against a Republican is publicized, no matter how trivial. Democrats are coddled-unless their conduct is so egregious that it cannot possibly be ignored. Whenever Jesse Jackson opens his mouth, especially against Republicans, he gets profuse, uncritical coverage, no matter how racially inflammatory and baseless his accusations are. Conservative blacks get almost no coverage.\n\nAlterman tells us that \"when it bleeds, it leads\". Nice try, but this does not absolve the media of its left-wing bias. There is a double standard against violence. Violence against homosexuals is reported, while violence by homosexuals is not. Right wing violence (e. g., abortion clinic bombings) is demonized, while left wing violence is not. The persecution of Christians worldwide has received almost zero coverage in the mainstream media, because it does not fit their agenda of who a victim is. One can go on and on."

He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not?\nI also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's \"Firing Line\" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative!\nBottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists."

After reading through the book, I came to discover that the liberal media is looked at differently than I look at it.  I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning about the different views in the media"

Many reviewers commented on the \"leisurely\" pace of the story, and I agree.  The description of the event in the climax of the story, though, I found too long and almost unbearably tedious, especially since such care with detail was missing from a lot of the other events in the book.  The time travel part was especially troubling to me; I wasn't at all convinced of its process.  However, I still enjoyed the book and was very satisfied with the ending.  As many have said, stick with it."

There is everything here, science fiction, mystery, action, philosophy, and a bit of romance.  Highly recommended."

The premise for the story is a young man, Si Morley, who joins a government program to go back in time to the NY of 1880's. The past is bought to life in a richly detailed and meticulously researched story.  Not only is it entertaining, containing romance and mystery, but it is also a commentary on how modernity has changed the city and its inhabitants something even more significant today.\n\nThis is a book you'll enjoy reading, one I can't recommend highly enough"

His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a \"quick, easy read\". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers)."

It was then I discovered how dependent I had become on someone else to provide for my financial future. I call it \"marital welfare\" -- and I do agree that we are a culture of dependent creatures -- and this fact usually smacks a woman right in the face through circumstances she least expects. Part of rising above all of this has been a dawning awareness of how important it is to take the financial responsibility for my future into my own hands. Kim Kiyosaki has put into words what has already been placed in my heart -- it was the \"you're on the right track\" message that I needed to hear to further my resolve -- not just in finances but in every area where self-sufficiency needs to evolve. The good news is that I am remarried to someone who supports my financial plans, goals and dreams and shares in the excitement. This book does not give a step-by-step how-to, but what it does do is bring about a birthing process that can literally change your life because it provokes you to change how you VIEW your life. For many people, that's all it takes, and in that regard, this book has accomplished wonders"

Women have the potential to be excellent business people and with training and practice can beat men at their own game. Most have a subtle advantage over men and don't have to deal with the big ego problems of having to, \"know it all.\" They just want to be winners and successful. Many just don't know where to start or how to get help. RICH WOMEN is a great start and savvy guide to financial freedom written for women"

I have to say this book is a pleasent surprise. It has no big discussion on the whites that cause all their problems, it is just a downright honest book about one life lived well. Sometimes Tavis arrogance comes through and I imagine there are those along the way that would have some say about that but it doesnt matter. This book outlines a black success story against incredible odds but more importantly it is an American success story. You can all learn alot about growing up black and growing up impoverished in America as I did from this. More importantly Tavis outlines how we can forgive and love one another which is most important.\nGreat book and a greater person."

Obama's critique of American politics and Dr. Green's\nevaluation of black American politics and their leaders, combined to give me perhaps the most\ncomprehensive review of modern American politics that I have ever read.   After reading\nSmiley's book, I had a more personal perspective, and most certainly after reading his Covenant\nwith Black America.\n\nWhat I found most telling about Sen. Obama's book was his honesty and straight forwardness.\nDr. Green's book was honest in an irreverent, directness that stimulated as much thinking about\nAmerica as it did the definition of American.   Smiley's book wrapped it up with a personal\nreflection on all that was hoped for, dreamt for and needed to have happen.  All three are must\nreads, preferably at the same time."

      "review_text": "Who is Tavis Smiley?  Initially Tavis' prominence in the media led me to think this guy was just a 'talking-head' - a person simply trying to find a means to move up in this world.  However, years have shown me I was wrong.\n\nTavis Smiley is a man of conviction.\n\nI have witnessed his passion and service and have been an indirect recipient of its affects.  His book \"What I Know For Sure\" shows that he is indeed a man of great determination and drive - and yes, he is in fact trying to go somewhere.  Yet, the beauty of the story and his life is that he desires to take a nation of folks with him.\n\nI greatly appreciate Tavis for having the courage to share his trials and triumphs with the public.  It was refreshing to read a story where a Black man's battles were not with drugs or sex, but with deeper elements that tend to birth destructive surface habits that deceivedly garner too much of our attention.\n\nThe deeper issues are: How do we navigate our spirituality and poverty, or better yet, our spirituality and our God given gifts?  Is one married to the other?  Does one negate the other?  Are there gifts to be used in religious confines, and then others meant for worldly consumption?  How do we as African Americans mature in mind to understand that \"God so loved the WORLD...\" that he gave gifts? Gifts to be used to open college doors, and business opportunities, and platforms for change -for a freeing of His people...\n\n\"What I Know For Sure\" is a great, easy-flowing story.  I am requiring my 17 year old son to read it.  I will give it as a gift to my nephews, brother, and brother-in-law.  I plan to send it to my childhood friend who is now in prison.  In fact, it is my hope that everyone who struggles to define, understand, or find evidence of \" Black MAN\" in today's society, might read this book, read \"Yellow Black\" by Haki Madhubuti, \"The Pact\" by Davis, Jenkins and Hunt, and Denzel Washington's new book, \"A Hand To Guide Me.\"\n\nThese books speak to contemporary situations, and will undoubtedly prove to be as relevant for this period of time as \"Souls of Black Folks\", \"Black Boy\" and \"Invisible Man\" were for theirs.\n\nGreat work Tavis!"

      "review_text": "\"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.\"\n-Napoleon Hill\nIf you asked me to recommend to you the single best book I have ever read, my answer would be a very definite \"Think and Grow Rich\".\nFirst published in 1937, this is the end product of two decades of research conducted by Napoleon Hill. His research started when Andrew Carnegie (the steel tycoon who was then the richest man on earth) gave him the assignment of organizing a Philosophy of Personal Achievement. Hill, who was a poor journalist, armed with just an introductory letter from Carnegie, set out to interview over five hundred successful people including Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman, William Wrigley Jr. and Charles M. Schwab. Hill then revealed the priceless wisdom of his research in the form of the thirteen steps to success (in Think and Grow Rich) and the seventeen principles of success (in courses and lectures he conducted).\nThe concepts taught by Napoleon Hill transformed my life. Some of these include developing a definite purpose, building a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA), channeling the power of the sub-conscious mind and dealing with adversity. Everything he wrote about or talked about is thought provoking. He was wise, humble and funny. His philosophy is universal; he did not mix it with religion. The riches he referred to were more than money, for the Philosophy of Personal Achievement can be applied to anything in life.\nThis is a classic, and hence the examples are old (not to be confused with outdated). But they are as relevant today as they were in the early twentieth century. Here is an example from T&GR in the chapter on Desire:\nOn the morning after the Great Fire of Chicago (1871), a group of merchants on Chicago's State Street went into a conference to decide whether to rebuild their stores or leave Chicago. All but one decided to leave. The merchant who decided to stay pointed a finger to the remains of his store and said \"Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the world's greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down.\" His name was Marshall Field and his store still exists, and in Hill's words is \"a towering monument to that state of mind known as a burning desire.\" I lived in Chicago from 2002 through 2004 and worked three blocks away from this impressive store on State Street. Sometimes I would visit it or stand outside it to derive inspiration and be reminded of the power of desire. It is amazing that Hill describes \"burning desire\" with a story based on the Chicago Fire.\nThere are thousands of self-help books out in the market and hundreds of self proclaimed \"gurus\" who have made a living by copying the wisdom in Hill's books. As I went through some of those books I realized that there was not much in them that Hill had not already written about. I recommend quality over quantity. Instead of reading through many books, I recommend that you study the following works of Hill and internalize his wisdom:\n1. Think and Grow Rich (1937) - I recommend the Action Pack edition,\n2. Napoleon Hill's Keys to Success : The 17 Principles of Personal Achievement - this is an excellent guide to his principles,\n3. Your Right To Be Rich [Unabridged] - this consists of 12 hours of live lectures covering the 17 principles, that Hill conducted in Chicago in 1954.\nBy internalizing, I mean studying in depth - analyzing the ideas, making notes and summaries. I own more CDs by Hill, but I believe that these 3 items make the perfect study plan on the Philosophy of Personal Achievement.\nSome have criticized Hill's work by stating that his research was unscientific. They pass him up for Jim Collins (whose \"Good to Great\" dedicates 76 out of its 300 pages to research methodology and notes that hardly anybody ever reads) or Marcus Buckingham (whose \"First Break...\" similarly uses 25 pages for Gallup's Meta Analysis and what not). These people don't know what they are missing.\nI am greatly indebted to Napoleon Hill. The purpose of my writing this is to spread awareness of his work so that more people can benefit from it. This, I believe is the best way in which Hill would have liked to have been repaid.\nIf my review was helpful to you, I request you to select \"Yes\" so that the rating is improved and more readers will get to read it. For more information on this author please read my \"So You'd Like To... Guides\" on the best management books and my other reviews (select my username to get to those pages).

      "review_text": "I have always taken good notes and tested myself on anything that I have read to make the material come to life. After reading Think & Grow Rich and after reading so many positive reviews here, I decided to go out and buy this one as well. To tell you the truth, it was sort of anticlimatic. The exercises were good, but I pretty much figured that out for myself without the guide.\n\nI had already read Think & Grow Rich at least a dozen times so thought I knew this material cold..and I did. BUT....when I went to the back of the book and took the 5 examinations, I had to admit that I knew what Napolean Hill wanted as answers but couldn't truly say in all honesty that I was where I needed to be or wanted to be in the five categories listed.\n\nSo I went to work on my weak areas which I thought I didn't have before reading this book. This part of the book alone was for me, well worth the price of buying this version of Think and Grow Rich.\n\nI think a lot of people will benefit from the Action Pack because so many people I know will read the book once and think they've got it. The action pack will make you roll up your sleeves, clear the mental cobwebs, learn the material but even more importantly, make the material bring out the qualities inside you that lead to success"

That usually sets me off - I don't like being mainstream.\n\nYet so many successful entrepreneurs told me to read it and I knew I'd be spending hours at the beach last summer anyway so I snatched up a copy.\n\nThis book was the start of a new way of thinking for me. A new way to think about business, relationships, money, my own power and the world.\n\nThe exercises in the back were at times cumbersome (I was really hoping that this book was an actual workbook that I could pen in.). Even still the exercises were a necessary part of my growth. I suggest everyone should get the Action Pack instead of the standard edition."

The Think & Grow Rich Action Pack is a great guide on how to \"personalize\" Think & Grow Rich to your walk in life. I discovered Think and Grow Rich when I read Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion and International Boxing Hall of Famer Ken Norton's autobiography \"Going the Distance.\" Norton shared in his book that he read Think & Grow Rich and it changed his life. Norton's book states he was prescribed to read Think & Grow Rich after he suffered his first boxing defeat and had to start over. He then went on to beat Muhammed Ali for the title. Norton shares in his book that he read Think & Grow Rich repeatedly during his career and he became a stonger person for it."

      "review_text": "I still have my original copy.  It's very tattered and worn after the 100s of hours of reading and re-reading, but it remains an important part of my life.  This book has had the most significant impact on my life than any other book I've read (not including the BIBLE).\n\nMany years ago I fell into some very difficult times.  I went from riches to rags.  By a stroke of luck, this book jumped off the bookshelf and saved my life.  It lifted me up, got me positive and helped me reshape who I was.  It has been my source of strength ever since.\n\nIt taught me how to take my dreams and make them a reality.  How I could focus my energy and teach myself how to become what it was I dreamed.  It taught me how I could organize my life, make a decision about what I wanted to do with it, and go after my goals with persistence.\n\nItstead of being depressed, I could establish a state of mind that could overcome any obstacle and go after any desire with confidence.\n\nNapoleon Hill interviewed the most successful people of his time and extracted the secrets that made them rich, successful and happy.\n\nI highly recommend this book.  If you're down in the dumps, it will lift you up.  If you're rich in money, but unhappy, it will show you how to refocus and join the riches of money with happiness.  Or even if your life seems perfect, it will revitalize you and help you realize the potential you didn't even realize you possessed.\n\nSo pick up this book.  The cost is insignificant when you see what it does for your life.  It will change it forever.  And the action pack reinforces the concepts and helps you apply them to your life."

      "review_text": "After graduating from college I questioned my education.  I guess I wasn't happy with the path that I chose.  Too bad that I realized that right after I graduated, however just by chance I read Michael Gerber's The E Myth Revisited.  The book completely geared me towards a different goal.  Instead of going into education I decided to pursue the idea of starting my own business.  That's when I decided to research books about success and what it takes.  I stumbled upon Think and Grow Rich, I read all the reviews on Amazon.com, and instead of buying the book I decided to rent a copy from the library.  I took few days to read it.  Right after I finished reading it, I decided to purchase my own copy.  It was possibly the most important decision I've made in my life.  I'd like to claim that the book changed my life, in addition I read several other books written by Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, Jeff Keller and many more.  However, I found that Think and Grow Rich served as a template to everyone else's work. Napoleon Hill presented his discoveries quite clearly, and if applied correctly these ideas were meant to change anyone's life.  Ever since then, I've found a way to buy a successful window cleaning franchise based out of St. Louis.  I'm proud to say that I couldn't have done it without the help of Napoleon Hill and his book Think and Grow Rich.  This book was not only written to get rich, but also to change people in a positive way.  Whether you want to make millions or be a better athlete, this book will definitely help you achieve any goals.  Like Napoleon Hill said, \"Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve,\" these are the words to live by!  This book should be your starting point towards life's riches, you can then follow up by reading Napoleon Hill's other books, as well as books written by other authors on the same topic"

      "review_text": "I am a personal growth coach and I do some work in the area of sexuality.  There are many people that are inhibited around their fantasies or feel guilt for having normal sexual feelings.  I feel this book is useful because it provides a wide array of different types of fantasies that are common in themes in the female population.  This can be a very helpful book to help people normalize their feelings of shame and guilt around their innocent fantasies.\n\nI also like that this book provides some psychological interpretation of female fantasies and is organized around themes.  The content is erotic, but tasteful.  On the other hand, people's authentic experience is captured and the content is not necessarily sugar-coated.\n\nI think this book will appeal more to women than to men.  Among other things, it will help women to realize that they are not unique in having certain desires that they don't fully understand or want to have happen in real life.\n\nTwo other great books that describe the psychology of sex and sexual fantasy are THE EROTIC MIND by Jack Morin and THE EVOLUTION OF DESIRE by David Buss"

      "review_text": "If we can get beyond the fact that all of us guys get super turned-on by this and love to read these fantasies, then we can objectively take a look at this book.\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that women down deep have the same drives, basically that men do.  They may have been taught to repress them or express them differently, but we are sexual beings-all of us male and female.  Nancy Friday does a great job of reminding us of that fact.  Yes, some things you read here are shocking and maybe unsettling, but remember, she just took the information sent to her and compiled the book.\n\nI found this book fascinating for many reasons"
