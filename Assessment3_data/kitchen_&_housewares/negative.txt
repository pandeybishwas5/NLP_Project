      "review_text": "He just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again!\n\nIt also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.\n\nIt does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker.  Terriers are just too stubborn to care if they're getting sprayed, I guess."

I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless."

My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower.\n\nI also couldn't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. Even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise. Not just me but my husband too so it's not a case of super human hearing on my part :-)\n\nYes the timer option is very nice. This was actually why I purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking. But what good is the timer function if the microphone can't pick up the barking?\n\nSo read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units. Unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else."

It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.\n\nI had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries.  Don't make this mistake"

      "review_text": "There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get"

      "review_text": "Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light"

The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment."

This product is  really just a step away from spoon and ice cube, and not a big step,  considering that it's not a complete solution. If the cooks's purpose were  to collect the fat--e.g., chicken schmalz--free from juices, it would  present the same problems"

It seemed to work all right, but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated! And if you buy the bags with the zippers, the zippers come off easily, they make sealing more difficult, and one even tore a hole in the bag. I purchased straight from AsSeenOnTV.com, but their return policy looks a little weird. I'm not sure if I'll get a refund. Also be careful if you order straight from AsSeenOnTV.com -- I upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later! I guess the product was just too good to be true."

My pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off.  I tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time.  It stuck even worse!  The pizza didn't get fully done in the middle, while the Pampered Chef pizza was perfect both times.  I will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from Pampered Chef.

If you decide to disregard the reviews, here are some things from the owners manual (which I read before using the iron - and followed to the letter) to give you an idea how temperamental/high-maintenance this item is:\n\n*Do NOT use distilled water. You can use tap water - if it's not too hard (less than 12 grains - who actually knows this?). Softened water can also cause problems. Basically, if you use anything except bottled water, expect problems!\n\n*Empty the water from the iron after EVERY use. Failure to do so will result in leaking or spitting\n\n*Other than the Rowenta Soleplate cleaning kits (which run about $12), the only instructions/recommendations for cleaning the soleplate are what NOT to  use.\n\nI had a very inexpensive Panasonic iron for years - given Panasonic is not really \"known\" for this type of item, my expectations were not high. It lasted 7 years with no problems and was low and/or no maintenance. Don't count on the Rowenta name to equate to higher quality on this one"

The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work.  Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem.  Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder.  Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised.  I'd never buy another remanufactured model.  But I still believe in Irobot."

      "review_text": "Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.\n\nThere is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard \"wave pattern\" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap\n\nCons:\n-Mashes your bread while it cuts\n-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness\n-The 'spiky' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.\n\nSuggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade"

I use them in my Weber barbeque when doing indirect heat cooking.

There is one available on the Internet that is sold as a Taylor probe replacement. These probes look the same (with the 90-degree elbow bend and the right-angle mini-plug), but they have a smooth grey silicone-rubber sheathed cable, instead of a metal braid sheath.  I bought several of these (reasonably priced, around $12 or so), and so far, they have worked like champs with no failures and accurate readings from freezing to boiling.\n\nI would not recommend these probes based on my experience with very high failure rates."

I always bake with an Exopat silicone mat on my sheets.\n\nUpon the first use, when they were placed in the oven, the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin.  The next thing I heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven.  Lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees F translates to poor heat conduction, and burned cookie bottoms.  This symphony of metal buckling, courtesy of my new $15 cookie sheets.\n\nEven with the Exopat silicone sheets on them, the cookies were barely done when I decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap, thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to \"double pan\" to prevent burning.  What a wonderful situation Amazon has presented me with - $90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets.\n\nYes, into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly, its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work-arounds to augment their performance.  These are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they're worse - with the price-point of supermarket wares, one can infer the quality that one is getting.\n\nI used to believe brands like Calphalon stood for quality, and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of, at least, mezzanine quality.  When I buy on the web and cannot better scrutinize the items I'm choosing, I tend to favor trusted brands.  As it turns out, these sheets did not have the Calphalon name on them anywhere - Calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -Made in China- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the Calphalon brand.\n\nWith the holiday baking season upon us, what do I plan to replace them with?  The Vollrath cookie sheets (not non-stick, but I use silicone mats, so do I care?) recommended in Cooks Illustrated magazine.  They're in stock at Chef Resource - their price everywhere is $19 but most vendors are out of them.  They're due to arrive via UPS day after tomorrow - Tuesday, 10/17.  Holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of Calphalon, apparently.\n\nIf I could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash, I would so rate them."

They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend."

Not exactly a good first impression.\n\nI then lifted the Roomba out of the box and I was immediately covered with dirt and dust.  The bottom of the box was also filled with dirt and dust and hair.  I flipped it over and discovered the brushes covered with dirt, dust and someones (or somethings!) hair.\n\nI was grossed out, but even worse, the other person in the room (who suffers from allergies) started to sneeze violently.  I spent the next 20 minutes thoroughly vacuuming the entire room and all other horizontal surfaces I could reach.\n\nI think it is very obvious that NOBODY did anything with this Roomba since the previous owner returned it besides transfer the polystyrene packing box to a new cardboard box that says \"Remanufactured\" on it!\n\nIn summary - BE VERY CAREFUL!!!\n\nIf you ordered a \"Factory-Reconditioned\", be aware that it might be pre-filled with someone elses dust, dirt, hair and who knows what else.\n\nI think I might have to bite the bullet and pay full price.  I like the idea of this product, but not the pre-filled one I received"

The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.

Yes, it will grate cheese, but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch.  This allows for the cheese to get 'gummed' up and eventually that large wad just falls through.  Also, for harder cheeses this means you're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated.\n\nI've yet to find a rotary grater I'm happy with.  I've broken several plastic models within 2 days of owning them.  While I've yet to break this metal model, it just doesn't perfrom very well.  I'm still using my stand-up grater"

To get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle, so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese.  I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg.  Neither drum worked satisfactorily. That may be because it is made in China where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown.  Yeah I  know it says MIU France but the box clearly says \"Made in China\".

The Braun burned out in the first 90 days, faster than my Black and Decker, Oster, even Hamilton Beach (though it lasted longer than Back to the Basics).  The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it doesn't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons (always look for a single switch, a knob, or a touch-pad).  Otherwise, their shavers have served me better, mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes.\n\nI'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic single-switch Oster another try, though I'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars"

Three smoothies later only one plastic tooth remains and it is starting to fracture.  (My smoothies were made of yogurt, O.J., some frozen mango... nothing extreme.)\n\nAs far as the crepes go, even with only one \"tooth\" remaining, this baby still can stir eggs, milk, and a little flour (thank you for small miracles).  But... the glass jug is a dribbler.  When you pour batter or smoothies or whatever, some of the liquid will always (I mean always) dribble off the glass jug's lip, down the front of the jug, down the front of the control panel, and also into the recessed area where those \"teeth\" meet each other.  So... you have to clean ALL the blender each time you use it (i.e., the jug, the control panel, the recessed area in which the jug sets) not just clean the jug. What a pain in the neck.\n\nOnce the last tooth breaks, this baby is going in the garbage."

The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!"

      "review_text": "Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice (\"rice cooker cup\")than it does for the water (\"regular measuring cup\"), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.\nYet another gripe is that it automatically goes into \"warm\" mode when it is finished. May be handy to have the warm option, but if you don't realize it's done and its left on \"warm\" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab.\nIt seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can't use it because of the above problems. \n\nOthers' experience may vary. Keep in mind I'm very good at ruining rice. I just don't need help doing it!\nDavid"

Here's the problem, I brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee EVER and I'm not even a big coffee drinker. To make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee. Who drinks only 4 ounces of anything. You would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak. Which is wear the waste of money comes in. The senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast. I personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning. I originally bought the Senseo because I didnt want to spend Tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get. Now the tassimo is great. I've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son. Everyone likes it. Good luck everyone."

Until then the best bet is to let the ice cream or frozen yogurt thaw in the fridge for a few hours, then stir it up with a spoon until it's the preferred level of softness"

It's designed to make soft-serve ice cream at home. The are not enpough pro's and way too many cons. the only Pro: It makes soft-serve ice cream when ever you want.\nCONS\n1. It's LOUD and Noisy\n2. The ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out.\n3. If not used correctly, it make a huge mess.\n4. It wastes ice cream. When you use this product, half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine.\n5. by the time its finished, ice cream is pratically melted.\n6. You ongly get about 1/3 of what you put in the machine. The rest gets stuck inside the machine.\n7. You have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine.\n8. You have to hand pump the ice cream into soft-serve yourself. \nThis Black & Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is such a waste of money. I So reccomend not buying this. Just going to Dairy Queen or Baskin Robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio"

This time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag, but the bag never sealed.\n\nI have watched the video several times and have read and re-read the instructions. At first I thought I was not operating it correctly, but now I believe the Foodsaver is the problem. The first time I used it, to seal a quantity of chicken for the freezer, it worked beautifully. It hasn't worked right since then.\n\nAnother problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material.

I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone.  If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.

Nope, did the same thing.  So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time.  For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker.  Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.  Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup.  Hopefully they'll improve it.  Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker"

      "review_text": "I have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother. She had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime. When I found the Kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere $4.97 at my local Sears, I snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen. \n\nIt's not a bad cookie press, but it's definitely not the best out there, I'm sure...and it doesn't stack up at all to my mother's old-fashioned one. As stated in another review, many discs don't seem to work at all well with this press. I tried the tree, candy cane, and star discs and every single one just squirted out an uneven messy blob. Somehow the press pushed out the dough unevenly out of the press, so that one side of the shape was a blob while the other side was barely out of the press. \n\nThe rosette, swirl, and ribbon shapes did fairly well, though they turned out much larger shapes than the older model I'm used to...hence extending the baking time of the cookies. I'm used to nice, thin, crispy ribbons, but this press turned out very thick ones. \n\nI was also not very fond of the ratcheting style of the press. It felt as though I had less control over it than the squeeze-gun type.\n\nIf I'd paid full price for this press, I would have been a bit upset at the quality, but having paid only $5 for it, I'm just disappointed because I had thought Kitchenaid to be a better quality brand than what I've seen in this cookie pres"

As it festers there, the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house.  This, to an extent, is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet, making more mess than you started with.  The first time this happened, Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit.  We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it.  Bissell only wants to send us another (no doubt defective) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky, urine-leaking, mess-maker, don't buy this product !"

I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute"

      "review_text": "This blender is frustrating. It offers good points, but in the end, the flaws outweigh the benefits. First the good:\n\nThe heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean. The powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease. When the blender is started, the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully.\n\nThe problems I found led me to toss the blender. If you plan on making blended soups, beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on. Without a heavy hand on the lid, both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling. Moderately thick, viscous liquids (a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar. This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended, while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy. Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area.\n\nThe above problems were annoying, caused occasional swearing, but  were tolerable. What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse. After several years of moderate use, the KitchenAid stopped working. The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth. These reduce operating noise, but over time, weaken. The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries. A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container. The rubber drive teeth slipped, and friction quickly heated them up. The result was hot, floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades. When this happens, it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use. Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped"

It would get there and just freeze.  \n\nAdditionally, the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is.  This makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical.  \n\nThe physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless.  It is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying.  \n\nAll said and done, after you replace the sugar, flavorings, creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using Robinson's Pyrex Candy Thermometer goes way up.\n\nUse a cup of ice water.  Or a more reliable brand of candy thermometer.  It's much better to shell out the extra dollars and get beautiful consistent results"

Since using this thermometer, I have ruined more batches of fudge than I care to think about.  If you want a good candy thermometer, don't buy this one."

I was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when I washed it in the dishwasher. Also, I liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been happy with this product. The Pyrex lids must be pried off with a great deal of strength and diligence. This is not a task for a child, or even a standard adult. I have had to ask my husband on more than one occasion to take a lid off for me. I have even spilled food in attempts to take lids off.  \n\nAs an aside, I have also found that the Pyrex glass is heavy, which makes it less desirable to carry leftovers to work AND the containers do not \"nest,\" so they take up more space than they need to in the cabinet.\n\nI recommend Bormioli glass storage containers instead. They are lighter in weight, they nest, and the lids come off with the strength of a normal person."

What was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even *smaller* box, packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst. Naturally this set was also shattered.\n\nFortunately, I hadn't yet returned the first order, so I was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second. I'm sure their returns department won't like hearing that, but as I see it I've saved them the cost of a refund.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be ordering ceramic flatware from Amazon again.\n\nOnce again, I like the style of the set itself, and think it's a great deal for the price.

It was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes.  I pulled it out and set it on the counter.  Well I leaned in to check the salmon and as I pulled away the glass exploded! Not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere.  Thankfully I pulled away when I did because if I had pulled away 2 seconds later I would have had a face full of Pyrex shrapnel. I came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach...and from what I've heard I was lucky.  Even though my boyfriend and I swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light I could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen.  Im not taking any chances, Im throwing out my other Pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays.  Please DO NOT USE PYREX! It is not worth the risk! You may have a few years of good use, but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children?\nEdit- I would just like to comment that I was using the dish within the guidelines. The oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes.  The kitchen was rather warm and the surface I set it on was not hot but definately not cool...so there was no drastic temperature change.  There were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so I do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault. This explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item"

It rained glass all over the inside of my oven.  It was a disaster.  I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time.  This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM!"

After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for \"spare parts\" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again"

I assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that I gave away. The first time I used it (as soon as it got up to tempurature) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top. Then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter. The lid is the worst! At first I thought maybe I was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid. Now I realize this is the way it was designed! I made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid. The only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter. Not to mention its probably a fire hazard. I don't think my paper towel idea is what Rival had in mind when they designed this! I wish I could return this but I threw away the receipt."

The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight?"

There are many positive reviews so I'm sure if you get a working one than you'll probably be happy with it. As for me, I refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn't even trying to remedy.

At that LOW temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso.  Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate.  This occurs when the grind is too fine.  I've had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine.  To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap.  I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble.  Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also.  The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother."

This machine is unbelievably finicky; you must use an extremely coarse grind (according to the manual), and almost zero tamping pressure (again, according to the manual), otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow (several minutes for a shot of espresso). Even when you get everything according to instructions (which includes, according to Capresso tech support, disassembling the machine every few days), it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso, which comes out weak, bitter, and with no crema. After two months of discussing this with Capresso tech support and getting nowhere, I returned the machine to Amazon. After that I bought a Krups XP 4000 -- bliss! The machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds, even with a fine grind and firm tamp."

      "reviewer_location": "Los Angeles, CA United States",
      "review_text": "This machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned European-style coffee drinker (coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean, not a tall cup of Sanka as the term is used in the US). Admittedly, I'm really picky about my coffee, but $250 for this machine is ridiculous. I've had coffee from a $40 Krups machine that is better than that made by the EspressoPro. I use high-quality pods with this machine (Molinari, Lucaffe, and Miscela d'Oro) which guarantees consistency in other machines, but doesn't help with this machine. Here are my issues with the machine. \n\n1. The thermoblock isn't effective. I HAVE to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm. Disgusting, even with high quality beans. Granted, unless your machine has a cup warmer, this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine, but with this machine, it is a REQUIREMENT, not an option, if you want hot coffee. \n\nSecond, steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day. The same heating problem occurs with steaming milk. I called Capresso, and they said to check all the fittings. In fact, after much frustration (I'm not an idiot), I finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube, which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak. Still, I can't get HOT steam. What I do get is either lukewarm liquid milk, or cool, overly thick foam. In fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it. Nasty. \n\n2. The frothing mechanism is gimmicky and not effective. A standard \"frothing wand\" is much better. The mechanism on this machine is ineffective, lacks true control, and requires an extra step over a standard wand to clean. \n\nAs explained above, the heat is not sufficient, and the quality of foam is irregular and bad. I'm embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests, let alone drink it myself. I just can't get over the heat issue. Nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat. This point is so important, if you take a gander at the Francis! Francis! X1 (and professional machines), there's a thermometer right on the front of the machine (and no, it's not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of gauges/switches on an espresso machine--like a pressure gauge). The low heat generated results in really thick, solid foam. When I have guests, I just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the EspressoPro's lame mechanism. \n\nSecond, the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective. A little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab. It's just not good design. Since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine, you can't really \"work\" the milk. A wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you're getting foam or hot milk. \n\nYou know dried milk that collects on your steaming wand? Well, that's now inside your EspressoPro. With a traditional wand, you just wipe the wand with a wet rag. With this machine, you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism (BEFORE you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again). Plus, there's so many little pieces that need to be kept clean, it's a pain. What a bad design! \n\n3. 18 Bar? Yeah, right. This machine also doesn't generate enough pressure to develop nice crema. Granted, I use pods, but still, a certain amount of crema is expected. This machine produces a thin, insufficient amount of crema. The lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock. \n\nI really can't recommend this machine. For $250, just go get a Krups or Braun. Better yet, spend $50 more and get an entry level Gaggia or Saeco. With this machine you're paying for looks and a gimmicky, ineffective frothing mechanism. This hunk o' junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet, as I truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else. It is now appropriately \"retired\" from service, and I now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my Saeco Vienna Superautomatica. Now that's a machine, baby"

Carafe positioning appears to be the problem, because it doesn't leak every time.  Maybe my unit is defective, because other reviewers don't mention this, and believe me, you would notice this if it were occurring with yours. \n\nThe opening to pour in water is relatively small, but I don't have a huge problem with it. Be aware there is no automatic shut off.  It makes a fine cup of coffee for this non-coffee-gourmet, and I don't have a problem with spilling when I pour from the carafe into a cup.  But the leaking is forcing me to find another machine.  \n\nI wish I could find a reasonably-priced, non-leaking 12-cup machine with removable water reservoir, no-drip carafe, programmable, auto shut-off, easy-to-find replacement carafe and removable filter basket but alas, even on amazon.com, that machine does not appear to exist.

      "review_text": "I had slightly older edition of the Krups Crystal Aroma for several years, until I lost one carafe too many - if you're careless, when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop.  But that's my fault.  The Crystal Aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water, but overall, the quality of the coffee it produces is merely OK.  \nThe reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that Krups now makes a much better one.  \"Aroma control\" is a poor description for the recent line of Krups coffeemakers by that name actually do.  The Aroma Control machines have a simple, but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe.  More than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas, that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world.  Unless you're just in love with that round carafe, skip the \"Crystal Aroma\" and move on to the \"Aroma Control\" line."

They kept sending the \"Commercial 5 mixer.\"  In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods.  I have ordered many  \"cookie\" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer.  This has been going on since the beginning of December.  But no mixer!\n\nCalls end up in whatever country.  All they do is placate you with polite rhetoric and pat answers.  Which is their job.  But this does not address the major problem.  The problem is never kicked up to a higher level, researched, investigated and thus ending in a resolution.\n\nNow I see this model or its equivalent, in Costo.  Very cheap but with the steel attachments (whip, dough hook etc) like the Commerical one.  It looks like a combination of the Pro 5 Plus and the Commercial one.  And the model no. is not listed in KitchenAde's website.  There seems to be something amiss with this Pro 5 Plus model. \n\nThis has been a frustrating experience.  I now plan to order the Pro 6 instead, which Cook's Illustrated listed as number one.  And it won't be from Amazon.  Receiving the wrong one three times is a bit much.  Dissapointed in the service."

Together these elements are a bad concept from the word \"go\", because they will ultimately separate because someone will at one time or another put them in the dishwasher. The metal is only tempered 4 times leaving the metal soft, meaning there is a lot of sharpeing to do. Henckel, cutco, trident are expensive and chefs all over the world use them because the are used everyday and they retain their sharpness because they are tempered 7 times (the maximum amount before metal becomes so hard that it becomes brittle) \n\nWood is pourus and is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. You don't just wipe off knives and put them in a wood butcher block? What moran came up with that great concept? Utensils need to be sterilzed through a dish washer and very hot water with good cleaning agents. \n\nWhy woould you buy a knife that you can't put in the dish washer? Why would you ever purchase a knife that requires maintenance. There's no moving parts\n\nWood handle and stainless steel spells disaster. Learning to sharpen your own knives is not easy, chefs don't even do it. Reading direction from a pamphlet and attempting to sharpen your knives for the first time spells disaster. Your knives will never be the same if you attempt this. Companies sell sharpening tools to inexperienced knife sharpeners (like yourself) so they wreck their own knives and buy new. You buy clothes that require dry cleaning, correct?  bring your knives in and have them professionally sharpened and protect your investment. You should only buy one pair of knives in your lifetime and they can be handed down from generation to generation. \n\nA dull knife is a dangerous knife. A dull knife will require more pressure which will lead to a person cutting themselves. \n\nTake it from me. I was a CEO with a company who marketed these knives to people like you and we made alot of money too. These knives were never designed to be passed on from generation to generation"

The packing materials are insufficient to say the least.  I immediately called target's customer service, and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table.

Unfortunately, the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks (and I'd thrown the receipt away, so I couldn't get my money back). Soon after that, the original box quit working, too. So, within about 6 months, I spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned.\n\nAfter researching better and more reliable options, I've settled on the Omega Paw box that you roll to clean. I now have three of them -- no electric parts to break, and, actually, less mess than the LitterMaid"

Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat.  Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily.  The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter).  After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up.  I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray.  The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time"

I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point.\n\nCuisinart's one has obviously some problems:\n 1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard.\n 2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio.\n 3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts.\n 4. Some basic cycle have no \"Pre-heat\" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail.\n 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula.\n\nOne of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart's. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things:\n 1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful.\n 2. \"Pre heat\" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more.\n 3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer.\n\nI think I never back to Cuisinart although I miss some points (Sophisticated design or the window on the rid which I can see inside of the case through) of Cuisinart a little bit. I highly recommend this bread maker."

First, Yes it burns the crust on MED; Second, I made 4, count them, four batches of their recipe bread and my recipe bread and they were ALL awful. Could not believe it. Each time I followed the reciped and instructions to the letter.\n\nI'm giving up the ghost and going back to my el cheapo bread machines that work every time. Love the style and the loaf shape of the Cuisinart but don't like wasting my time and ingredients. Maybe I got a lemon"

But let's start witht he good things first.\n\nPROS:\n1. It's big, I like the size a lot\n2. It's gridded, so I don't need to worry about cookies falling off the rack. They are steady right there.\n\nCONS: \nThe biggest problem is the material, it is not strong at all!\n\nWhen the rack arrived, the middle of it was already bent (or sagging a bit). I was able to bent it backwards easily, yet that \"perfect\" posture didn't hold for long, it's back to its bad sagging position again very soon.\n\nThen it got way worse, when I try to cool cakes on it. Cookies aren't that bad, since they are light. When I have the moist and right out of the oven cake sitting on that rack, the middle of the rack is barely touching my kitchen counter top already. Of course, as soon as I lift my cake up, it goes back to the normal sagging position.\n\nI think unless you are planning on baking cookies only...this is not a rack for you. Pick something else, something stronger"

      "review_text": "This is a gorgeous ice bucket. It is large and stylish.  However, I cannot recommend it because of the lid.  The lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off.  Instead, it pivots and swings up.  The problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing.  And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler.  Poor design flaw.  I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You'll notice in OXO's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up.  Why?  Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way.  Hey OXO, that's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar! \n\nWould it have killed OXO to put a knob/handle on the lid and let the customer decide if they want the lid on or off? I swear sometimes I think manufacturers never bother actually testing out the things they design. If they had, surely they would have noticed how bad their lid idea was.  Or they could have looked at every other ice bucket on the market to see that theirs is the only one in which the lid doesn't come off.  That should have been a clue to them that there are obvious merits to having  a removable lid.\n\nThis bucket has a clear plastic lid.  I don't understand why it's plastic at all.  First of all, it's an ice bucket!  I think everyone knows ice is inside without needing to peek through the lid.  Secondly, a metal lid will keep the temperature inside colder longer than than a plastic lid. That is why the bucket is made of metal, not plastic.  Metal is a better conductor of heat and cold. \n \nI wish I had noticed the lid before I purchased it.  I didn't pay close enough attention. I suppose I assumed it was a normal lid that came off like all the others.  Thankfully I got the bucket from my local Bed Bath & Beyond making its return very easy.  I am sorry I have to return it  because this really is a nice looking bucket. However, I don't intend to spend $40 on an ice bucket just to sit there, look pretty and receive compliments--that's my job as hostess :-).  I want an ice bucket that is functional too.  \n\nOh, well...my search for the perfect ice bucket continues."

I am thankful that my model is 525 watts...I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!\n\nMy best advice is to pick up an inexpensive pasta machine or an Emperia hand crank pasta machine. They run between $20-40 without a motor or $80-120 with a motor (that you can also buy separately for $50-80). --A very small price to pay, if you want to keep your KitchenAid Stand Mixer!"

I came home that night and the hours had not changed. I realized I didn't click the on/off button to start heating the cooker.  This may have saved a house fire.  I went ahead and changed the time from 10 to 4 hours.  This set the unit to high instead of the original low setting.  Not 15 minutes after turning on, the outer covering was melting.  I immediately shut it off.  I see the 4 quart units were recalled back in 2004 for similar issues.  Whatever their problem, it has not been fixed.  Be aware of this serious problem when using your slow cooker.  I am returning mine and will exchange for a different brand"

      "review_text": "My first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings.  I have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven. The statement on the inside instructions \"WHEN COOKING IN A BARBECUE OR SMOKER, DO NOT USE AS A CONTINUOUS READ THERMOMETER, USE ONLY AS AN INSTANT READ THERMOMETER.\", \"5. DO NOT USE THIS UNIT TO MEASURE COOKING TEMPERATURES OVER 392&#9702;F.\" as well as \"WARRANTY EXCLUDES THERMOMETER PROBES.\" should be on the outside, letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk.  If you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours, a cheap $6.00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat.  Why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86&#9702; to 572&#9702; if you can only use to 392&#9702;.  I would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit's instructions, but 275&#9702; in the oven killed mine so maybe not?  Cut to the chase, look for a better unit and let me know when you find it"

We attempted to correct the problem with Cuisinart via e-mail and phone calls and the issue still is not resolved and therefore we are returning the ice cream maker.\n\nNegative points aside, the ice cream maker did make great ice cream. (Thanks mostly to the Ben and Jerry's recipe book we ordered at the same time.)  We'll look into getting a better quality ice cream  maker in the near future. It won't be made by Cuisinart"

I would have thought that Henckels wouldn't make any actual crap, but this set comes awfully close.  The good thing is, boy are they sharp.  But there's bad things too.  Only the 8\" chef's knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all, the rest are -very- thin and flimsy.  'Laser-cut' edges are overrated - make them another millimeter thick please, so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction. A good knife is an extension of the cook's intention - it does what you want, and does NOT require thought and pre-conception and compensation in every cut. (...)is waaay too much for one adequate chef's knife and some toys.  Very disappointed in Henckels, and in Amazon too, I don't feel I got what I ordered."

If he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low.  Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done.

I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs.

I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in, but with the weight of the set (because it really is a heavy-duty set of flatware) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time.  So, I am just putting my experience out there to help others make an informed decision"

A few years ago, we received a  Krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it! However, this particular toaster rarely worked. In fact, I would say that 85% time it would either not toast or would \"flip\" the toast prematurely e.g. 5 second or less. I have no idea if this is a  fluck in quality control or not, but I highly recommend buying a  different toaster. I know, I thought, Krups makes a toaster? Wow, I'll buy it, after all how hard can it be for a German company to manufacture functional a toaster? Well, evidently, they have issues."

The appliance came with a notice that implored you to please call the Back to Basics if there is a problem (rather than the retailer) so I did.\n\nI was told they would send a replacement cup immediately. \n\nI can boil eggs in it which is great but you can't toast at the same time so either your toast or your eggs get cold while waiting for the other.  \n\nAs I approached my 30 day return period, I called back and was told that the cups were being redesigned and they would send one out immediately.\n\nToday (now 64 days after the first call) I called again and was told that my cup was mailed 10 days ago (but only 7 business days so they won't even discuss tracing or resending until next week).  They mailed it from Utah.  I live in Seattle. \n\nI am so not happy with their service, their attitude and now I'm even getting annoyed at the appliance.  Hopefully, no one else will have this problem.  But, just in case.."

I had not used it as it did not seem worth the trouble to plan on getting it out ahead of time and charging it for 15 hours when I could use a manual grater right when I needed it.  Last week, I needed to shred some cheddar for a recipe.  I read the instructions front to back, allowed it to charge the full amount of time, and I was pretty excited when it came time to try it out.  Right from the start, I knew it was junk.  You are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade.  Not mine.  The plastic piece kept coming off, and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures.  I decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability.  Once I started trying to grate, I had a really hard time getting the thing to shred.  I tried varying degrees of pressure.  As others commented, the cheese does get stuck EVERYWHERE.  Then, the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds.  I did not get the nice big shreds that I am used to with my manual grater.  My husband thought I was doing it wrong, so he tried it.  He had the same result.  I will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill, because people are better off without it.  Since it was a gift, I'm glad I'm not out any money.  It is going in the trash"

I froze the gel disk as instructed, bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream, cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed.  After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup. You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat.  I put it in a container in the freezer.  The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.  \n\nIf this isn't enough to deter you keep in mind that the \"heavy cream\" called for in most of the recipes listed in the booklet costs a pretty hefty price.  I paid $2.50 for the heavy cream listed to make 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  That price doesn't even include the other ingredients listed.  \n\nBuyer Beware"

I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. \n\nJust to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don't need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat.  Not cooking for a crowd?  Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won't want to share. I don't slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is. \n\nIn fairness, when I gave my neice two of my unused large pastry/baking mats, she used them successfully to make her chocolate dipped strawberries, turtles, etc."

      "review_text": "I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch.  I had read other reviews of the Bissell Little Green Machine that were unfavourable, so headed off to the store to find something else . . . . the Atlantis Express looked interesting, and I hadn't seen it before.\n\nSuffice to say, it did get the cat stains out of the couch, but not after revealing itself as a really poorly designed product.\n\n- The machine is LOUD, very loud\n- The cleaning 'head' on the end of the hose has a 'flip-up' cover to make it easier to clean where it sucks in lint and stuff into the machine.  That is a great idea, but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor, it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up.\n- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine.  However to accomplish this, the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside.  Neither are centered, the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse.  As they are not centered, they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head.  To top it off, when you release the trigger, the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments, meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere.\n\nWhile it functioned well enough to clean my couch, it was a brutal and terrible experience.  When I bought it I figured it could be used too on my car interior . . . . but the frustration of cleaning a small patch on my couch quickly quelled that thougt.\n\nI returned the Atlantis Express to the store and went out and bought a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. -- which I should have done right from the start--- the hoover runs circles around this machine"

With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer.

I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won't be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet"

Unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps, the water filters do about as much as a rain dance.\nPass on this one"

The temperatures were no where near the extremes of the thermometer's range, so this wasn't a case of shutting down because of that. ... I e-mailed the manufacturer about the problem and was told I could return it to them for replacement. I did this and less than three weeks later received a new one from them. Surprise, surprise -- this one behaved the same way, shutting off after 4 or 5 minutes even while its readings were changing. I e-mailed Taylor again about this and suggested they check out their existing supply of this model, as I suspected they had many that were shutting down like this. ... Approximately two weeks later ... I received another package from them containing one of their model 9845 thermometers, a different model! I received no communications from Taylor about this, other than their original e-mail stating I could return my original thermometer to them for replacement. I don't know what I'll do now.

The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either)  I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more.  It was not a pleasant experience.

      "review_text": "Unfortunately, I've ordered more than my share of FoodSaver products, having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage,  despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers.\n\nWhat many of them claim is very much to the point: plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum.  I've had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses.  It seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics.  The smaller containers seem to last longer. Those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer.\n\nIn plain language, the plastic containers are unreliable.  FoodSaver should develop materials and designs that can handle the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them, or quit the the business.  Since their products have been on the market for many years, I can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than satisfying existing customers. If you like filling out warranty forms every few weeks, more power to you.\n\nBottle sealers are equally worthless.  Every one that I bought lost vacuum in short order.  In one case, a defective seal resulted in a spill of cooking oil that damaged a nylon tent and other camping gear.\n\nFoodSaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line.  The vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably, as long as the instuctions are followed.  The bagging system is unassailable, even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high (read Consumer Reports reviews).  And, to be fair, their Universal lids are excellent.  Use them to seal  small glass jars or stainless steel bowls, and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic.\n\nBottom line?  Be careful which products you buy.  Some are excellent, while others are pure junk."

      "review_text": "This percolater makes great coffee and I was very happy with it until it broke within two years. Actually the first thing that broke was the little plastic knob on the top. I called the company and they were very nice about it. They quickly sent me a replacement part. I thought, what a great company. Then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after I bought it I called them again. They explained that it was no longer under warranty (I think I missed the warranty term by a month or two.) They offered that I could purchase a refurbished one from them for about half the price of the original (I paid about $70.00, a refurbished one was, I think, $35.00) but it came with no warranty and I'd have to pay shipping. I was very, very disappointed. Thankfully, I had my old drip coffee maker in the attic. I pulled that out and have been using it although it does not make as good a cup of coffee as this percolator did. \nThis product should have lasted me years. I am looking for another good cordless percolator but would not consider another product by this company. I gave it the two star rating instead of one because it did truly make a good cup of coffee but the two year life is just not worth the cost"

The box told me to set the temperature to 375 degress. Guess what, there is no 375 degree temperature on this unit. There is a 355 and 390. Other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are 350, 400, 450. 425 is the only relatively common temperature setting that is found on this Toaster Oven. \nAs a \"don't fire up the big oven heating up the house on a hot summer day\" unit, this toaster oven comes up a little short"

It heats up quick and produces steam well etc, but it performed far below what I thought were reasonable expectations.

The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.

The motor is still good, and the blades are still good, but they used a little plastic coupler between the two and it lost all it's teeth one by one. We mainly like to make milkshakes and smoothies about 3 or 4 times a week."

I dismantled the whole unit - it then worked for about 2 days.  I called Kitchenaid - (they are right about no hassle warranty)  They quickly sent me out a new one.  This new one lasted about 6 months - and now has the same symptoms.  I really wish this was the grinder for me - I LOVE the Capacity for bean storage and LOVE the way it looks - I have been forced to look at other grinders.\nHope this helps.  By the way - I used grinders twice daily - in the morn and then in the evening - not like I was putting a whole lot of strain on them!\nHope this help"

The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan"

You have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out. It is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it. I wonder if the Calphalon pan is the same??? As far as the pot set I ended up buying-Analon Titanium 12 piece. Highly reccomend it"

      "review_text": "Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off.  For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).  \n\nCons: The toaster part is horrible.  This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time.  Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn't work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off.  Also, the bottom rack is completely useless when toasting, so the fact that they are touting this as a 6-slice toaster oven is misleading."

It is loud, but who cared? \nThe problem is that it only lasted for about 3 months before it just quit working, along with a little puff of smoke. Two weeks before the fatal puff, the fan arced, popped, sparked, and gave off a puff of smoke, but it still worked. Two weeks after that it sparked and puffed and has not turned on since.\nI live in Hawaii and it is currently in the rainy season. There has been a lot of humidity in the air during the last month, and I noticed that the back of the fan was actually getting rusty. I thought perhaps that moisture was the cause of the sparking so I was surprised to read in another review that the fan was good to use during heat and humidity!\nThe fan was sitting in front of the living room window and it kept the whole small 2 bedroom house cool. We miss it, but I can't keep buying a new fan every 3 months! \nThis is the first time ever that this has happened with a fan that I purchased. I have been living in Hawaii for 13 years and have been through a lot of fans. One of the best-lasting fans I had was a $10.00 Lasko box fan. It lasted and worked well for 7 years before it quit working"

I thought I could use the recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake and have 4 4.5-inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts.  \n\nHowever, while the areas are the same, the volumes are not.  The pans are not deep enough.  While a 9-inch springform pan is 3 inches deep, these 4.5-inch springform pans are 1.5 inches deep.  Therefore, if you use the recipe for a 9 inch cheese cake, you have a lot of batter left over.  If you half the recipe, you produce baked goods that taste something like cheesecake but not as dense or as moist or as rich.\n\nI was very disappointed in these pans.  They may be good for something, but I don't know what.  They are well-made, so I won't throw them away, but right now I feel like they were a waste of money"

First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on.  It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the \"feet\" back on and the knob, they broke again right away.  \n\nCleaning is a pain, and the non-stick stuff got scraped right off. The food tray that goes on top is hard to clean too.\n\n Don't try to cook burgers in the basket, because they shrink as the fat drips out, no matter how tight you make the basket, and they start sliding around and falling apart as they hit each other. \n\nCooking times were always longer than the cookbook says.  \n\nI used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they're so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs.\n\nI still use it, but I wouldn't buy a 2nd one after reading all the reviews.  I think I'll try a George Foreman one next time"

Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids.  Getting them out is a real pain, you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them.  Just a mess.\n\n2.) If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone.  Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction.\n\n3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself.  I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously.  Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating.\n\nI guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes.  For me, I've decided to get one of those Vollcraft units.  It's on order"

That pan lasted about 3 years and I got my money's worth.\n\nThe positive review from America's Test Kitchen is what pointed me in this direction.  The Farberware pan was a joy to use when I first bought it and I loved the even heat.  All of the positive comments are accurate at first.\n\nThe problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it's nonstick properties almost completely.  I never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat.  I was always very meticilous about the way I cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic.  I even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface.\n\nI have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago.  With the exception of one ultra cheapo model I have NEVER had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly.  Of course I can send this back to Farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it's nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault.  Why waste $10 in shipping costs?  This is my last Farberware product.\n\nAfter writing this first part of the review I thought it would only be fair to email Farberware to let them respond.  After doing some googling I have found that there is no email.  It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone.  They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA.  As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.  If this isn't really Farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service?  You can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you'll get an eyeful.  BUYER BEWARE"

I am still waiting for a refund on the product after 2 weeks.  The last message I got was that \"it may take a bit longer.\"  So be sure this is what you want before you buy it.  Returning it is not easy.  And getapc.com charges a $60 reshelving fee on top of the shipping you'll have to pay to send it back.  My markeplace experience has been very frustrating.

If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven ,the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable.  Even at lower temperatures, the heat finally takes its' toll...it just takes longer for it to happen.  One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat.

They both arrived within a week of one another. \n\nBoth boards were treated with heated food grade oil and allowed to sit and soak it in. After wiping off the oil, my board had surface cracks, where the oil had pulled some of the glue out from between the bamboo pieces. Within the first month of use, both boards developed cracks all the way through them. Both boards were never soaked in water, but just wiped with a damp cloth.\n\nThis board may be beautiful, but it quickly became unusable and a waste of money. Now I'm looking for a good hardwood cutting board. (I've already replaced the gift board with another.) \n\nAll in all, this fiasco of a cutting board has cost me around $150...and I have yet to replace my board"

However, it was very disappointing.  On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped.  If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no?  I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped.  I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping.  I never had to take the top off of it.  Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs.  Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad!"

My second gripe is the clean and dirty water reservoirs are in the same small space. I had to change it out about every 10 minutes. The machine gets one star for the dual brushes which I think are a positive for this machine. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep it. It would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact I had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area. I've had a Hoover for 8-10 years and will look to see what new machines Hoover has on the market."

Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality"

As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers.

This should give you an idea of what K-Mart thinks of the quality of the Hamilton Beach 40616 perculator.When I  called Hamilton Beach customer no-service I was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for $9.95 and they would replace their defective equipment. The $9.95\nis 25% of the original price of the perculator so I will decline their offer. If their perculator only last for 8 months I don't even want to pay the $9.95 to get a new one. I feel that it should have been replaced for free! In their warranty booklet they tell you that the 40616 perculator has a limited 2-year warranty but that is only if you are willing to pay $9.95 to ship their defective equipment back to them. Because of this experience with the Hamilton Beach 40616 coffee perculator I will never purchase any Hamilton Beach equipment in the future.I will also not purchase anything else from K-Mart"

It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.  I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.  It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it"

I have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven't owned these pots for long\n\nI am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental.  After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp.  Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads.  After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food.  I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.

This is NOT user error I have tried different coffees, grinds, and positioning the carafe differently. This coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake. Finally I got KitchenAid to buy the coffee maker back and got a Cuisinart one. It works perfectly, costs less, and has more features.

I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  \n\nI use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.\n\nBut, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer's seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.\n\nI did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don't make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.\n\nFrom a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product-- yes it's beautiful but it's not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were"

I was given this a gift a year ago and was thrilled  - until I used it. \n\nI really wish they'd go back to their original smooth enamel finish. This must be an attempt to produce an interior more durable for using metal utensils with. An attempt that in my opinion is a failure. Things (like eggs and hamburgers) stick to this finish. You have to use a lot more fat to prevent sticking. It's hard to get clean, takes quite a bit of scrubbing even after soaking. It doesn't give the finish to grilled meats, etc that I want from a fry pan. Forget deglazing it to make a sauce. I find my All Clad 9 inch skillet to be a superior performer to this one.\n\nSince this is a 9 inch skillet, I haven't used it to saute onions, etc., so I can't say how it performs with these items. \n\nI do use it to make cornbread and to roast small portions of meats or veg in the oven, with good results (as long as I'm not going to use the browned bits to make a sauce). This to me though, is not enough uses to justify buying it."

      "review_text": "I, too, own several KitchenAid products and have been delighted with previous products. When I needed a new coffee maker, I decided to switch brands to KitchenAid based on prior history with the company.\n\nHOWEVER, this is the WORST coffee maker I've ever owned, including cheaper models.  I'm now on my second coffee pot after KitchenAid sent me a new one when the one I ordered failed.  While the company has been more than understanding, I hesitate to call again because I don't even want another one.  Getting my money back shouldn't lie with the hands of the seller I purchased it from.\n\nHere's the problem.  After a week of use, the water and grounds kept spilling over and coffee was not draining into the pot, saturating the electric plate and my kitchen floor. When I could get it just right (standing there holding the carafe in place), the coffee tasted burnt. \n\nI thought I had a defective product, but the new one is starting to do the same thing. The carafe does not stay in place and slides forward when placed on the electric plate (until there is enough coffee dispensed. The coffee carafe is supposed to push (when it's in the right place) on the plastic piece that releases the coffee.  It's a design problem.  It's definitely cheaply made. I have to stand next to my coffee maker as it's brewing to make sure the coffee is dripping. \n\nBelieve me, I wouldn't have bothered writing this if I didn't think it might save someone else the headaches. Buy something else! It's not worth the hassle."

When I called the company the not so brilliant guy told me that they hear this all the time on this model and that you just have to push the coffee maker in far enough so that the pause n serve feature isn't activated...well, unless we put a heavy ceramic bowl in front of the carafe to hold the pot in place we have coffee soup all over our counter and floor.  \n\nMy husband and I love coffee and we like it STRONG!  We feel coffee is very important to survival in our home as we have 5 kids and this helps us stay alive and energetic for the 48 hours a day we care for them!!  \n\nMy strong advice...don't but this model.  Though Kitchenaid is a great product and I have never had problems with any of their other lines, this one should be junked!  We are returning ours!"

For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker.  We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid).  Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.  I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location.  I wouldn't recommend KitchenAid to anyone, regardless of the nice styling and supposed high-quality."

The finer the grind, the more water leaked out. Keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino.\n\nUsing a coarse grind, which is usually only used for cowboy coffee out on the trail or French press machines, I still get quite a bit of leakage. Using finer grinds produces more and more leakage leaving only about half a carafe of extremely strong espresso which is indeed more like cowboy or french press coffees. -I enjoy cowboy coffee but would prefer espresso from my espresso machine plus I hate all the mess.\n\nThe Krups machine I had fifteen years ago worked well but this machine sucks big time. If you don't want to fork over a lot of bucks for a \"real\" espresso maker, try a Mr Coffee espresso machine. Mine, which I use when I travel, cost less than twenty dollars and does not leak.\n\nIn the meantime I have ordered a Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker to replace the Krups. -I'll keep you postsed.\n\nBilly Bat"

There's 3 of them so it makes it very easy to carry without any fuss of the cake dropping on the floor. The handle of the carrier also gives a comfortable grip.  Carrier is also see through so you'll notice if the decorations have been messed up during the transporting process.\n\nNOT so Good things:\nNOT very durable. Locking mechanism that holds the base of the carrier may crack making it non portable.\nThis product is susceptible to breakage perhaps because certain stores just have had these items on their shelf for a long time-- that's only my assumption. Plastic should not crack unless it's placed in extreme temperatures or is abused. Should the temperature in the fridge crack a plastic? Very unlikely don't you think?\nThe price is also far cry compared to other products sold by discount stores (i.e Linens../WlMrt. Other carriers are sold from $4-$9.\n\nThe height is good but it can be problematic when storing it in the fridge, but aren't all cakes difficult to store regardless?\n\nIn terms of cleaning the base, you'll need a brush to really get the bottom cleaned up"

Coffee all over the counter every time.. I suspect that using the pods created back pressure that ruptured something internally. \n\nBased on the fact then when used as intended it fails miserably, I would have to say that it is an example of shoddy engineering.. Junk, Garbage, Crud\n\nBTW - If yours is working, I found that the secret to decent tasting coffee was to wash the pod holder (the presto mypod) with soap and water every time and throw the pod holders in the dishwasher once in a while. \n\nI guess they let some three year olds design the thing on a 'take your kids to work' day."

The toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller, more conventional toaster oven.  The Rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate.  We found out the hard way when we had chicken grease overflow out of the grill and onto the counter.  I can see this being a very good item for those with very small kitchens and in need of saving space, however, be warned that this oven has many shortcomings"

You have to manually turn the crank with your hand.\n\nI returned this piece of junk, and bought the VillaWare V5500 10-Square Ravioli Maker for $18. Save yourself some money and do the same"

I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn't have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use"

Well, I fixed that rubber thing back into place, but it still kept spraying boiling water.  SO, right now it's sitting in the corner waiting to be thrown out.  \n\nI'm very frustrated with this product, but love the way that clothes steamers work.  It looks like I'm going to have to bite the bullet and buy an expensive one.  But, how expensive should these things be?

      "review_text": "I am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.  The problems I had were:\n\n1.  The cord is too short: directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door.  The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home.\n\n2.  The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet.  I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect.  After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made.  The water spat out on the material.  I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse.\n\n3.  The steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse.  The is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle; it is silk, not that hard of a material.\n\nI have read other reviews, and if this machine worked for them, I don't know how, but I can attest to the operation of the steamer that I purchased.  I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.  Conair GS4 Compact is a bust."

This is a horrible little machine.  It won't grind more than a couple of seeds at a time & forget chopping!  The grinding unit won't rotate most of the time.\n  \nIt's going to the Salvation Army as a donation."

This new toaster oven burst into flames when making toast filling my house with rank smoke and nearly setting my kitchen cabinets ablaze.  This is a very dangerous appliance that, based on my experience and other reviews here, should probably be taken off the market and recalled"

      "review_text": "Although I like the concept of these storage containers, they crack very easily.  The bottom of one of the largest containers had cracked during shipping. (Still useable for dry things like flour)  Then as I was sitting on the floor putting the containers away in a bottom cabinet, I dropped on from 1-2 feet above a linoleum floor -- it too chipped and cracked at the point of impact.  Also, when I first unpacked the containers, one of the lids came apart and the bottom half became stuck in the container.  We had to use a knife/fork and 2 people to pry it out, doing some damage in the process.  I believe the Click Clack folks have developed a second or even third generation of these containers.  Perhaps they are sturdier.  On the positive side, I did store some tomatoe sauce in one of the containers and it did not stain"
